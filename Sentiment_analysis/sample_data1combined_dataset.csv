"not many television shows appeal to quite as many different kinds of fans like farscape does...i know youngsters and 30/40+ years old;fans both male and female in as many different countries as you can think of that just adore this t.v miniseries. it has elements that can be found in almost every other show on t.v, character driven drama that could be from an australian soap opera; yet in the same episode it has science fact & fiction that would give even the hardiest ""trekkie"" a run for his money in the brainbender stakes! wormhole theory, time travel in true equational form...magnificent. it embraces cultures from all over the map as the possibilities are endless having multiple stars and therefore thousands of planets to choose from.<br /><br />with such a broad scope; it would be expected that nothing would be able to keep up the illusion for long, but here is where ""farscape"" really comes into it's own element...it succeeds where all others have failed, especially the likes of star trek (a universe with practically zero kaos element!) they ran out of ideas pretty quickly + kept rehashing them! over the course of 4 seasons they manage to keep the audience's attention using good continuity and constant character evolution with multiple threads to every episode with unique personal touches to camera that are specific to certain character groups within the whole. this structure allows for an extremely large area of subject matter as loyalties are forged and broken in many ways on many many issues. i happened to see the pilot (premiere) in passing and just had to keep tuning in after that to see if crichton would ever ""get the girl"", after seeing them all on television i was delighted to see them available on dvd & i have to admit that it was the only thing that kept me sane whilst i had to do a 12 hour night shift and developed chronic insomnia...farscape was the only thing to get me through those extremely long nights...<br /><br />do yourself a favour; watch the pilot and see what i mean...<br /><br />farscape comet",Movie,English
"the film quickly gets to a major chase scene with ever increasing destruction. the first really bad thing is the guy hijacking steven seagal would have been beaten to pulp by seagal's driving, but that probably would have ended the whole premise for the movie.<br /><br />it seems like they decided to make all kinds of changes in the movie plot, so just plan to enjoy the action, and do not expect a coherent plot. turn any sense of logic you may have, it will reduce your chance of getting a headache.<br /><br />i does give me some hope that steven seagal is trying to move back towards the type of characters he portrayed in his more popular movies.",Movie,English

"expectations were somewhat high for me when i went to see this movie, after all i thought steve carell could do no wrong coming off of great movies like anchorman, the 40 year-old virgin, and little miss sunshine. boy, was i wrong.<br /><br />i'll start with what is right with this movie: at certain points steve carell is allowed to be steve carell. there are a handful of moments in the film that made me laugh, and it's due almost entirely to him being given the wiggle-room to do his thing. he's an undoubtedly talented individual, and it's a shame that he signed on to what turned out to be, in my opinion, a total train-wreck.<br /><br />with that out of the way, i'll discuss what went horrifyingly wrong.<br /><br />the film begins with dan burns, a widower with three girls who is being considered for a nationally syndicated advice column. he prepares his girls for a family reunion, where his extended relatives gather for some time with each other.<br /><br />the family is high atop the list of things that make this an awful movie. no family behaves like this. it's almost as if they've been transported from pleasantville or leave it to beaver. they are a caricature of what we think a family is when we're 7. it reaches the point where they become obnoxious and simply frustrating. touch football, crossword puzzle competitions, family bowling, and talent shows are not how actual people behave. it's almost sickening.<br /><br />another big flaw is the woman carell is supposed to be falling for. observing her in her first scene with steve carell is like watching a stroke victim trying to be rehabilitated. what i imagine is supposed to be unique and original in this woman comes off as mildly retarded.<br /><br />it makes me think that this movie is taking place on another planet. i left the theater wondering what i just saw. after thinking further, i don't think it was much.",Movie,English
"i've watched this movie on a fairly regular basis for most of my life, and it never gets old. for all the snide remarks and insults (mostly from david spade), ""tommy boy"" has a giant heart. and that's what keeps this movie funny after all these years.<br /><br />tommy callahan (chris farley) is the son of big tom callahan (brian dennehy), master car parts salesman, and has ridden on that all his life. but after his died dies on his wedding day, tommy learns that the company is in debt, and about to be bought by ray zalinsky (dan akroyd), the owner of a huge car parts company. so in order to save the company, tommy has to go on the road to sell the company's new brake pads. along for the ride, though not by choice, is richard hayden (david spade) a former classmate of tommy's who was big tom's right-hand man.<br /><br />the movie rides on the chemistry between the two snl stars (and real-life best friends) chris farley and david spade. the duo has enough comic energy going between them to power the world. it's the big, dumb guy versus the smart little guy. it works, and some of their scenes are unforgettably funny. farley and spade are actually decent dramatic actors as well. although the film is primarily a comedy, it has its fair share of drama, but spade and especially farley are just as good there as when they're making the audience laugh.<br /><br />forgive me, but i have to talk about chris farley a little more. i read his biography (""the chris farley show: a biography in three acts,"" for anyone who cares), and understanding who chris was in real life made this movie more special to me. chris farley was a genuinely good person who struggled, and ultimately failed to conquer his addictions. although this was the first movie he had a major role in, it is his best film. it really showed who he was, and just how much talent he had. knowing chris's story adds another layer to this movie, although it doesn't make it any less funny.<br /><br />farley and spade are matched with a good on screen cast. rob lowe is suitably slimy as tommy's ""new brother,"" and bo derek is solid as his step-mother. brian dennehy is great as big tom. dennehy makes it easy to believe that they're father in son. big tom is just as crazy as his son, although he's smarter and more mature. dan akroyd gives one of his best performances as zalinsky, giving tommy the hard truth behind advertising. julie warner is also good as tommy's love interest, michelle.<br /><br />for me, peter segal is one of the great comedy directors. he keeps the pace quick and energetic, but most importantly, he knows how to make comedy funny. he doesn't belabor the jokes, and he understands that funny actors know what they're doing and he allows them to do it. but segal goes a step further. he gives ""tommy boy"" a friendly, almost nostalgic tone that both tugs the heartstrings (genuinely) and tickles the funnybone.<br /><br />critics didn't like ""tommy boy."" shame on them. a movie doesn't have to be super sophisticated or subversively intellectual to be funny (god forbid farley and spade were forced to do muted comedy a la ""the office""). this is a great movie and one of my all-time favorites.",Movie,English
"for once a story of hope highlighted over the tragic reality our youth face. favela rising draws one into a scary, unsafe and unfair world and shows through beautiful color and moving music how one man and his dedicated friends choose not to accept that world and change it through action and art. an entertaining, interesting, emotional, aesthetically beautiful film. i showed this film to numerous high school students as well who all live in neighborhoods with poverty and and gun violence and they were enamored with anderson, the protagonist. i recommend this film to all ages over 13 (due to subtitles and some images of death) from all backgrounds.",Movie,English
"okay, i didn't get the purgatory thing the first time i watched this episode. it seemed like something significant was going on that i couldn't put my finger on. this time those costa mesa fires on tv really caught my attention- and it helped that i was just writing an essay on inferno! but let me see what hasn't been discussed yet...<br /><br />a twop review mentioned that tony had 7 flights of stairs to go down because of the broken elevator. yeah, 7 is a significant number for lots of reasons, especially religious, but here's one more for ya. on a hunch i consulted wikipedia, and guess what dante divided into 7 levels? purgatorio. excluding ante-purgatory and paradise. (the stuff at the bottom of the stairs and... what tony can't get to.) <br /><br />on to the allegedly ""random"" monk-slap scene. as soon as the monks appeared, it fit perfectly in place with tony trying to get out of purgatory. you can tell he got worried when that christian commercial (death, disease, and sin) came on, and he's getting more and more desperate because christian heaven is looking kinda iffy for him. by the time he meets the monks he's thinking ""hey maybe these guys can help me?"" which sounds like contemplating other religions (e.g. buddhism) and wondering if some other path could take him to ""salvation"". not that tony is necessarily literally thinking about becoming a buddhist, but it appears finnerty tried that (and messed up). that slap in the face basically tells tony there's no quick fix- as in, no, you can't suddenly embrace buddhism and get out of here. <br /><br />tony was initially not too concerned about getting to heaven. but at the ""conference entrance"", he realizes that's not going to be so easy for him. at first i saw the name vs. driver's license problem as tony having led sort of a double life, what with the killing people and sleeping around that he kept secret from most people. he feels free to have an affair with quasi-melfi because ""he's kevin finnerty"". he figures out that he can fool some people with kf's cards, like hotel receptionists, but it won't get him out of purgatory. those helicopters- the helicopters of heaven?- are keeping track of him and everything he does.<br /><br />after reading all the theories on ""infinnerty"", though, it seems like kf's identity is a reminder of the infinite different paths tony could've taken in his life. possibly along with the car joke involving infiniti's that made no sense to me otherwise. aaaand at that point my brain fizzles out.",Movie,English
"i was very disappointed with this series. it had lots of cool graphics and that's about it. the level of detail it went into was minimal, and i always got the feeling the audience was being patronized -- there was a lot of what seemed to me as ""this is extremely cool but we're not going to explain it in further detail because you won't get it anyway. let's just show you some pretty pictures to entertain you."" the host would drop interesting-sounding words such as ""sparticles"" and ""super-symmetry"" without any attempt at explaining what it was. we had to look it up on wikipedia.<br /><br />furthermore, i know quite a bit about superstrings (for a layman) and i found their explanations were convoluted and could have been so much better. they could have chosen much better examples to explain concepts, but instead, the examples they used were confusing and further obscured the subject.<br /><br />additionally, i got so sick of the repetitiveness. they could easily have condensed the series into one episode if they had cut out all the repetition. they must have shown the clips of the quantum café about 8 times. the host kept saying the same things over and over and over again. i can't remember how many times he said ""the universe is made out of tiny little vibrating strings."" it's like they were trying to brainwash us into just accepting ""superstrings are the best thing since sliced bread.""<br /><br />finally, the show ended off with an unpleasant sense of a ""competition"" between fermilab and cern, clearly biased towards fermilab. this is supposed to be an educational program about quantum physics, not about whether the us is better than europe or vice versa! i also felt that was part of the patronizing -- ""audiences need to see some conflict to remain interested."" please. give me a little more credit than that.<br /><br />overall, 2 thumbs down :-(",Movie,English
"the first 30 minutes of tinseltown had my finger teetering on the remote, poised to flick around to watch something else. the premise of two writers, down on their luck, living in a self-storage-space ""bin"" was mildly amusing, but, painfully bland.<br /><br />the introduction of the character, played by joe pantoliano - the big deal movie guy, that lives in the park and sleeps in a lavatory, offered hope and i decided to give it a few more minutes. and then a few more until kristy swansons introduction as a budding film director & borderline nymphomaniac, added a bit of spice. her solid acting performance raised her presence above and beyond just a very welcome eye-candy inclusion.<br /><br />ultimately, the obvious low-budget impacts on the film with poorly shot scenes, stuttured pace and slapstick handling of certain moments. some of my favourite movies of all time have been low budget, whithnail & i being one that also deals with 2 guys with a dream, but down on their luck.<br /><br />however, for my money, the actors save tinseltown from the ""terrible movie"" archives and just about nudges it into the ""could have been a cult movie"" archives. i laughed out loud at some of the scenes involving joe pantoliano's character. in particular, the penultimate scenes in the terribly clichéd, but still funny, rich-but-screwed-up characters house, where the story unravels towards it's final moments.<br /><br />i can see how tinseltown was a great stage play and while the film-makers did their best to translate this to celluloid, it simply didn't work and while i laughed out loud at some of scenes and one liners, i think the first 30 minutes dulled my senses and expectations to such a degree i would have laughed at anything.<br /><br />unless you're stuck for a novelty coffee coaster, don't pick this up if you see it in a bargain bucket.",Movie,English
"jeez, this was immensely boring. the leading man (christian schoyen) has got to be the worst actor i have ever seen. and another thing, if the character in the movie moved to america when he was ten or something and had been living here for over 20 years, he would speak a lot better english than what he pulls of here. or to say it in my own language ""skikkelig gebrokkent"". but it is cool to see norwegian dudes in a movie made in hollywood. it was just a damn shame they were talentless hacks. the storyline itself is below mediocre. i have a suspicion that christian schoyen did this movie just to live the dream, as he clearly does in the film by humping one beautiful babe after another.",Movie,English
"great just great! the west coast got ""dirty"" harry callahan, the east coast got sharky. burt reynolds plays sharky in ""sharky's machine"" and i enjoyed every minute of it. playing a maverick narcotics cop in atlanta, ga is just what everyone wants. instead of suspension, he's sent to vice squad. like in the dirty harry movies or any other cop movies, the captain is always going to be the jerk. when i was a kid, i was curious what that movie meant ""sharky's machine"". well i knew who played sharky, i wonder what his machine was. it was his group of fellow cops. after uncovering the murder, he goes all out to find the perp. when it turns out to be a big time mob boss, sharky doesn't play around. when he gets the other prostitute into safety, sharky fights back hard and good despite losing a finger to the thug. and i also like the part where the bad gets blown out of the building through a plate glass window. that was the bomb! randy crawford's ""street life"" really put the movie in the right mood, and the movie itself is really a great hit to me, always! rating 4 out of 5 stars.",Movie,English

"this movie starts off somewhat slowly and gets running towards the end. not that that is bad, it was done to illustrate character trait degression of the main character. consequently, if you are not into tragedies, this is not your movie. it is the thought provoking philosophy of this movie that makes it worthwhile. if you liked dostoyevsky's 'crime and punishment,"" you will probably like this if only for the comparisons. the intriguing question that the movie prompts is, ""what is it that makes a renowned writer completely disregard his publicly-aproved ideas for another set?"" the new ideas are quite opposed to the status quo-if you are a conservative you will not like this movie. <br /><br />besides other philosophical questions, i must admit that the movie was quite aesthetically pleasing as well. the grassy hillsides and beautiful scenery helped me get past the slow start. also, there was use of coloric symbolism in representing the mindstate of the main characters. if these sorts of things do not impress you, skip it. overall i give this movie a 7.",Movie,English
"this is a slightly uneven entry with one standout sequence involving an over-the-hill gang reminiscing in the diner that once - thirty years previously - was their hideout; one ho-hum duologue between two ageing rock musos; a noirish kidnap turned on its head and an opening sequence (plus epilogue) involving heist artist wannabe edward baer and current 'hot' property anna magloulis which has its moments. no movie in which jean rochefort appears can be dismissed lightly and here he shines as one of the over-the-hill quintet, indeed the film is worth seeing for rochefort alone but each of the sequences has something to offer and it's definitely worth a look.",Movie,English

"this movie has very good acting by virtually all the cast, a gripping story with a chilling ending, great music, and excellent visuals without significant special effects. it is interesting to note though that, like so much science fiction, its predictions for the future don't appear likely to come to pass as early as depicted. that's not to say we're out of the woods yet, but 2022 is now obviously too soon to be in this condition. it shares this failing with a fairly illustrious list of science fiction classics: ""1984"", ""2001: a space odyssey (compare its space station with our international space station) and isaac asimov's ""i robot"" (positronic brains were to have been invented in the 1990's).",Movie,English

"the production quality, cast, premise, authentic new england (waterbury, ct?) locale and lush john williams score should have resulted in a 3-4 star collectors item. unfortunately, all we got was a passable 2 star ""decent"" flick, mostly memorable for what it tried to do.........bring an art house style film mainstream. the small town locale and story of ordinary people is a genre to itself, and if well done, will satisfy most grownups. jane fonda was unable to hide her braininess enough to make her character believable. i wondered why she wasn't doing a post doctorate at yale instead of working in a dead end factory job in waterbury. robert diniro's character was just a bit too contrived. an illiterate, nice guy loser who turns out to actually be, with a little help from jane's character, a 1990 version of henry ford or thomas edison.<br /><br />this genre has been more successfully handled by ""nobody's fool"" in the mid 90s and this year's (2003) ""about schmidt."" i wish that the main stream studios would try more stuff for post adolescents and reserve a couple of screens at the multi cinema complexes for those efforts.<br /><br />i'll give it an ""a"" for effort.",Movie,English

"with all this stuff going down at the moment with mj i've started listening to his music, watching the odd documentary here and there, watched the wiz and watched moonwalker again. maybe i just want to get a certain insight into this guy who i thought was really cool in the eighties just to maybe make up my mind whether he is guilty or innocent. moonwalker is part biography, part feature film which i remember going to see at the cinema when it was originally released. some of it has subtle messages about mj's feeling towards the press and also the obvious message of drugs are bad m'kay.<br /><br />visually impressive but of course this is all about michael jackson so unless you remotely like mj in anyway then you are going to hate this and find it boring. some may call mj an egotist for consenting to the making of this movie but mj and most of his fans would say that he made it for the fans which if true is really nice of him.<br /><br />the actual feature film bit when it finally starts is only on for 20 minutes or so excluding the smooth criminal sequence and joe pesci is convincing as a psychopathic all powerful drug lord. why he wants mj dead so bad is beyond me. because mj overheard his plans? nah, joe pesci's character ranted that he wanted people to know it is he who is supplying drugs etc so i dunno, maybe he just hates mj's music.<br /><br />lots of cool things in this like mj turning into a car and a robot and the whole speed demon sequence. also, the director must have had the patience of a saint when it came to filming the kiddy bad sequence as usually directors hate working with one kid let alone a whole bunch of them performing a complex dance scene.<br /><br />bottom line, this movie is for people who like mj on one level or another (which i think is most people). if not, then stay away. it does try and give off a wholesome message and ironically mj's bestest buddy in this movie is a girl! michael jackson is truly one of the most talented people ever to grace this planet but is he guilty? well, with all the attention i've gave this subject....hmmm well i don't know because people can be different behind closed doors, i know this for a fact. he is either an extremely nice but stupid guy or one of the most sickest liars. i hope he is not the latter.",Movie,English

"after three outstanding bbc television series' and a christmas special, the bizarre and grotesque (yet perversely lovable) characters of bleak fictional town royston vasey make the jump to celluloid, along with their creators - the league of gentlemen. <br /><br />mark gatiss, steve pemberton and reece shearsmith are the more familiar three-quarters of the foursome, with the central roles shared between the trio. in an added twist, the final member of the team - jeremy dyson - is portrayed by actor michael sheen. <br /><br />where to start? dyson (sheen) is in conversation with his writing cohorts, when - horror of horrors - he is paid a visit by two of his grisliest characters. both tubbs (pemberton) and edward tattsyrup (shearsmith) are unhappy at the league's decision to kill off the vasey inhabitants. ""you're not real!"" screams dyson in vain, as the local shopkeepers from hell exact their revenge. mayhem ensues, as reality and vasey converge with the vast array of characters entering our world to save theirs. <br /><br />confused? you will be, as the camp, innuendo-ridden teutonic, herr lipp (pemberton) is forced to take on the daily guise of pemberton (pemberton), while pemberton (pemberton) is kidnapped by cannibalistic butcher hillary briss (gatiss) and geoff tipps (shearsmith). <br /><br />with shades of an even more demented misery, briss attempts to force pemberton to rewrite the film - thus continuing his life - but leaving geoff in charge is never a good idea. the erstwhile comedian becomes embroiled in the league's latest, post-vasey adventure - the king's evil - entering a typically twisted 17th century england, complete with cameos from victoria wood, peter kay and david warner. known as george of asda (due to his select line of clothing), geoff saves the day and is treated as a hero, but for the denouement of the film, he joins characters old and new at the church of royston vasey to meet with their makers. <br /><br />for fans of the series, the film is a must-see. and yes, it does feature papa lazarou (albeit a little too fleetingly). pen-loving pauline, mickey, barbara and cursed vet matthew chinnery are some of the other favourites on show, and the league's portrayal of themselves (plus sheen's as dyson) is also a fascinating insight. <br /><br />the league of gentlemen are the radiohead of british comedy - they are ambitious, groundbreaking (witness the excellent series three) and not happy to rest on their laurels. they also divide opinion accordingly.<br /><br />certainly, their macabre sense of humour is not for every palate, and while not written exclusively for 'fans', a grasp of the storyline would benefit those who have previously viewed the series. nevertheless, apocalypse is a film in its own right and the league will no doubt manage to attract a new breed of fan, as well as appeasing and pleasing existing ones.",Movie,English

"i'm writing this note as a chess player as well as as a movie viewer. i watched the 1997 kasparov-deep blue games on the internet. i know something about the issues that were raised. other chess players will come along and want to know whether this movie is worth seeing/buying, and i'm talking largely to them. however, i'll try not to ignore those who aren't ""into chess"".<br /><br />this movie is about the 1997 match between garry kasparov and the custom-built computer ""deep blue"". however, the first image you see in the movie is not of kasparov, or of the computer, but of ""the turk"". this is an ""automaton"" which was built in europe at the turn of the 18th-19th century and played winning chess against all comers. i put the word ""automaton"" in quotes because it was, as everyone now knows, a fake. there was a man inside it.<br /><br />if you don't like seeing ""the turk"", then you won't be able to stand the movie, because ""the turk"" has as much screen time as kasparov, maybe more, both in modern footage and in b/w footage from some old movie. the reappearance of ""the turk"" every few seconds underscores kasparov's charge that ""deep blue"" had human assistance - that it was (to some degree) a fake computer, that ibm cheated, that there was ""a man inside it"" working behind the scenes to help it win. not only does kasparov believe this, but the filmmakers seem to believe it too. and so this is not really much of a movie about chess games or about programming chess computers. it is a propaganda piece about a big corporation supposedly misusing a helpless grandmaster. really it is a lot like a ""negative campaign ad"", as it is chock full of ominous music and evocative camera work and spooky sound effects and innuendos (""we never found out what was behind that locked door"") and the ever-present ""turk"".<br /><br />now, most people in the chess community are pretty much convinced that ibm did not cheat and that this was garry's paranoia at work. to start with, in order for a human to help ""deep blue"" beat kasparov, it would seem that you would need a human who was better than ""deep blue"" and better than kasparov. since there was no such person, the whole idea is a bit suspect from the start. furthermore, by the time this movie was made, there were computer programs that could run on your pc that could beat strong grandmasters. today, much more than in 1997, we take it for granted that a computer can do things you might not expect. and we are less likely to take it as a monumental human tragedy that a computer beat a guy in chess. (and in fact, the bottom line is that kasparov beat himself with two bad mistakes, including resigning game 2 in a drawn position.) <br /><br />as for the chess games, you actually see very little of them. there are a few comments from masters and commentators that tell briefly how they went, but really you don't get to see hardly any of the strategy or tactics at all. naturally as a chess player i take this as a major shortcoming, but i think that non-players are being cheated too. imagine a baseball movie, for example, where you don't hardly get to see any of the game - just a commentator telling you that ""in game four, the white sox defeated the astros with such and such a score."" nobody would make a movie like that. but here, for example, we are told that kasparov made a bad blunder in the opening of the decisive game 6, but we aren't shown the position on the screen, or told why it was a blunder, or what he should have done instead, or anything. we just see a few seconds of kasparov holding his head in his hands, and then more atmospheric sound effects and camera work.<br /><br />(since i saw this on dvd, let me warn chess players about the dvd as well. the jacket promises you that the extras include the games ""with analysis"". is this grandmaster analysis, which people like us might find interesting? no! it is the automated computer voice synthesizer analysis from some version of chessmaster, that tells you when a piece is attacked and a pawn gets isolated and that you are in the ""caro-kann defense, main line"". blahhhh.) <br /><br />someone might then come along and say, ""well, clearly this movie is meant to dramatize the match for the non-player, and so it's unfair to be impatient with it."" but actually it doesn't do a very good job of reaching out to the non-player either - it skates over some points that a true novice would really want to have explained. for example it says that kasparov could have gotten ""perpetual check"" in the second game, but it doesn't explain what that is (or show what it would have looked like on the board, which would have been interesting). it flashes back to the kasparov-karpov matches but doesn't explain why there were two of them or who organized them etc. i didn't need this information myself, but i'm familiar with it. if you don't already have chess experience, there are places where you are going to be confused, and this is just a defect in the film.<br /><br />ultimately i can't recommend the movie, which, like ""the turk"" itself, is not what it purports to be (a documentary) but more of a stage illusion.",Movie,English

"definitely one of the lesser of the astaire/rogers musicals. it's just very poorly plotted and paced. it only runs a few minutes longer than swing time, for example, but it feels a heck of a lot longer. this is partly due to the secondary romance between randolph scott and harriet hilliard. scott is rarely ever interesting. i like hilliard. she's sweet, and i love at least one of her songs, ""but where are you?"" (""get thee behind me satan"", her other number, is a weak leftover from top hat, thankfully cut from that masterpiece). follow the fleet would actually be a bad film if not for at least three brilliant dance sequences between astaire and rogers. the dancing contest vies for the top spot of any of their numbers. the dance is just fantastic. ""i'm putting all my eggs in one basket"" presents the two rehearsing a dance that they don't quite have perfected yet. its imperfections make it all the more perfect. and ""let's face the music and dance"" is easily one of irving berlin's best songs. so the film is well worth watching for its great moments.",Movie,English
"gwoemul (the host) - due to pollution in the han river a mutated beast goes on the rampage. the youngest member of the park family is snatched by the beast, and it is up to the rest of her family to find her, before she becomes the beast's latest meal.<br /><br />firstly, i love monster movies: mutated bears, over-sized alligators, packs of ravening komodo dragons, the whole lot. creature features are my favourite kind of horror film. so, i really wanted to like the host, but it wasn't to be. <br /><br />there were three major problems with it:<br /><br />the first can be seen with a quick look at it's imdb page<br /><br />genre: action / comedy / drama / fantasy / horror / sci-fi / thriller<br /><br />too many damned genres. it took itself too seriously to be a comedy, and yet was too light hearted to have any real message (though it did seem to be trying to make some kind of statement. anti-pollution, anti-american or anti-government). the drama was misplaced and mixed in a confusing mish-mash with all the other styles.<br /><br />secondly, after the initial monster attack nothing happens for almost the entire film. the central family wander about looking for one of their own while the governments of korea and america, apparently, do nothing. and that's it, they just wander about, occasionally hitting one another, presumably for a bit of comedy relief. this lack of action made my attention wander, and apparently it did the same for the director, as whole plot threads go unresolved (a mystery plague invented by the evil americans is completely forgotten about, and is never resolved).<br /><br />and lastly, the film is clumsily political. it paints the americans as being stupid and evil, but gives us no american characters with any more depth than a cartoon villain. the opening scene has the most obvious stupid american vs wise korean moment. with a korean morgue assistant asking his boss, the coroner, not to pour chemicals into the han river. the american coroner all but cackles maniacally as he orders the assistant to carry on. as well as being racist, it's lazy film-making and there is no excuse for that.<br /><br />on the plus side, the monster is good, kind of a mix of the relic and deep rising. some of the movement effects are quite cool, and the initial monster chase through the park is a lot of fun. there are also some nice shots in the film. some of which remind me, strangely, of the way firefly was filmed (shuddering cameras, out of focus shots etc).there is also a nice scene at the end, where the hero and a little boy he has saved are sitting in the family's mobile food stall. it's night-time and snow is falling, the street-lamp is giving out a cold light, but the food stall has a warm glow coming from it.<br /><br />overall, i was really disappointed by this film. i'd been looking forward to a decent creature flick, and instead i get some pseudo-political,horror-comedy lite. looking at the comments on imdb i can't help but think that if this had been a us production it would have been slated. just 'cause it's a foreign flick doesn't mean it's any good. there have been some great movies out of korea in recent years (the vengeance trilogy and brotherhood, for example), but this certainly isn't one of them. <br /><br />for once i'm in favour of a remake. tighten up the directing, improve the scripting and this could have been a nice film. as it is, it's not worth a couple of hours of anyone's time.",Movie,English
"i confess to have quite an uneasy feeling about ghosts movies, and while i sometimes enjoy the genre when it comes to horror, but when it comes to comedies, they really need to be crazy to be funny. 'over her dead body' seems to take afterlife a little bit too seriously, and fails in my opinion from almost any aspect i can think about. the story is completely unbelievable of course, and did not succeed to convince me either in the comic or in the sentimental register. the choice of the principal actresses was awful. while paul rudd is at least handsome and looks like a nice guy, the taste in ladies of his character seems to need serious improvement as eva longoria seems too aged (sorry) for him, and lake bell seems too unattractive (sorry again). a romantic story without good enough reason for romance is due to failure from start. jason biggs and lindsey sloane were actually better but they had only supporting roles. the rest is uninteresting and uninspired, with flat cinematography and cheap gags borrowed from unsuccessful tv comedies. nothing really worth watching, nothing to remember.",Movie,English
"this was a popular movie probably because of the humor in it, the fast-moving story, an underdog character who shuts up all the loudmouths, etc. funny thing is, you probably couldn't make a movie with this title if you substituted anybody but ""white"" as anything else would be deemed racist by the pc police. <br /><br />nonetheless, woody harrleson as the white guy who turns out to be as good if not better than any of the black basketball players, is interesting as is his main counterpart wesley snipes.<br /><br />snipes had a lot of funny put-down lines, providing much of the humor. the bad part of the film - which doesn't bother a lot of people - is the extreme profanity in here and the sleaziness of all the characters. that includes woody's girlfriend, played by rosie perez. there are no really clean, nice people in this movie. for that reason, i can't honestly recommend the film, at least not to friends or those who are offended by a lotof profanity",Movie,English

"with the exception of family, this new season is worse than season one. i can't imagine what they are thinking. as a fan of horror, can tolerate a lot of gore and mindless mayhem, but this series gets worse with each outing. i can't imagine how disheartening it must be for the actors and crew to go to work each day, toiling to churn out such crap. story! is that too much to ask for? character! how can we give damn about the fate of anyone in these stories? if we are not engaged, who cares if they get carved up or whatever? almost every episode ends with mindless blood letting, going for gross out shock without any sense of revelation or conclusion or reason why we have been subjected to an hour of bloodletting. even dante's effort this season had some disturbing sexist violence and wandered off to a pointless conclusion. ironically, the production values and performances tend to be up to speed, while the content is utter crap. i have great hopes for exec producer's garris's valarie under the stairs, but we shall see.",Movie,English
"if there was some weird inversed oscar academy awards festival this flick would win it all. it has all the gods, excellent plot, extreme special effects coupled with extremely good acting skills and of course in every role there is a celebrity superstar. well, this could be the scenario if the world was inversed, but it's not. instead it's the worst horror flick ever made, not only bad actors that seem to read the scripts from a teleprinter with bad dyslexia, but also extremely low on special effects. for example the devil costume (which by the way is a must-see), is something of the most hilarious i've ever seen. whenever i saw that red-black so called monster on screen i couldn't hold my laugh back. and to top of things it looked like the funny creature was transported by a conveyor-belt.<br /><br />do not do the same mistake as i did. checking imdb seeing that the movie was released in 2003, had less than five votes and thinking: -""well, it's worth a shot, can't be that bad"".<br /><br />yes it could.<br /><br />i'm not even going to waste more words on this movie.",Movie,English

"it wasn't notable enough to be truly horrible, it was just incredibly lame. the story was not half bad, but the execution was just horrendous.<br /><br />to start with, it moved too fast for us to emotionally get involved with what was going on. it was just paced badly. the dialog was so utterly un-sparkling, just flat and boring.<br /><br />and the characters, cripes almightly, they made deadpool boring. how the hell do you make deadpool boring? he wasn't even funny. he wasn't crazy. he was just an annoying guy with a couple of swords he did not even know how to use properly.<br /><br />gambit was boring. and since when did he have telekenisis to make the cards just float and fly around, or super strength to leap hundreds of feet into the air? and what the heck was up with all the stupid helicopter moves? i mean, we know they are mutants, but they still exist within the realm of physics. a round bo staff is not a helicopter blade, you cannot fly by twirling super-duper fast. which gambit wouldn't be able to do anyway. nor deadpool, especially when using it as a replacement for real fight choreography.<br /><br />and this film stands as proof that wire work should only be used by fight coordinators who know wth they are doing, and know better than to use it in every. single. shot. as a replacement for real fight choreography.<br /><br />three of the most physical fighters in marvel comics (logan, creed, and wilson), and some of the worst fight choreography i have ever seen in recent film memory. it was as if the stunt coordinator just shrugged his shoulders and left it all up to the special effects guys.<br /><br />and then you had the break out, with all these mutants who did nothing. even mutants who had been shown in their cells to have powers (nice to see a quicksilver nod), did f-all when they got out. only emma-really-lame-for-this-film-frost and cyclops did something.<br /><br />and since when was logan so pretty? and the stupid, ""the bullet will take his memory away."" don't you think xavier and the x-men would have noticed the big freaking bullet holes in his adamantium skull when they x-rayed him in x1? i felt sorry for liev schrieber man, he actually brought in a good sabretooth considering the script. he made one of marvel's more simple super villains feel real. but he could not save the film from it's own epic lameness.<br /><br />seriously, this was ""daredevil"" level of suck. decent story, good actors, absolutely horrible execution.",Movie,English
this unpleasant film has little to recommend it. dolph lundgren gives a performance that is better than either this script or his other action films have allowed. and there are occasional snippets of dialog that suggest the film might have been able to provide some insight into a bizarre subculture.<br /><br />but no. motivations are either murky or trite. most of the acting is sub-par. the script creates needless confusion. and the director's needless fascination with focusing on gore is distracting.<br /><br />it's hard to imagine who the audience is for this film.,Movie,English

"i too was fortunate enough to see ""checking out"" with peter falk at the phoenix film festival. this is an extremely sweet character driven film that leaves the audience enthralled in the applebaum's plight in life. more than funny, each character in the family contributes priceless comic relief that not only spurs laughter but inspires a few joyful tears as well. peter falk was born to play this role. he plays a 90ish ""young"" father of three who brings his adult children together in what could possibly be one of the most important times in his and their lives. the 2 day journey that the applebaum family takes though the delightful backdrop of new york (with carefully selected characters), not only leaves the audience wanting more, but nourishes ones own sense of family. ""checking out"" is a must see film, not only for all those who cherish family, but also all those who don't!!! my thanks to the director who took the chance to bring this gift to its audience. robin sly, scottsdale, arizona",Movie,English
"eyeliner was worn nearly 6000 years ago in egypt. really not that much of a stretch for it to be around in the 12th century. i also didn't realize the series flopped. there is a second season airing now isn't there? it is amazing to me when commentaries are made by those who are either ill-informed or don't watch a show at all. it is a waste of space on the boards and of other's time. the first show of the series was maybe a bit painful as the cast began to fall into place, but that is to be expected from any show. the remainder of the first season is excellent. i can hardly wait for the second season to begin in the united states.",Movie,English
"when i saw the trailer for this film, i said out loud to no one in particular ""this film is going to bomb."" i also said that about the matrix and look at what happened there. now i am not a box office guru by any stretch but i usually have a pretty good gut about what is going to be good and what is going to really suck. in this case i was blinded by my complete and utter apathy towards david duchovney. let me put it to you a different way: i don't like his as a person ( from what i have read of him in interviews, he is unbelievably pre-madonna like and he is full of himself considering all he has done is x-files ) or as an actor. playing god was a really poor film but he came off thinking that for some reason he deserved big bucks on the big screen. but i am happy to say that even though those things may still be true about the man, return to me is delightful and has it's heart in the right place. bonnie hunt has directed a beautiful story and she has told it with class and grace. this is one of the most romantic films i have seen and even though it may seem to be a bit sad and maudlin in its premise, give it a chance and you will be hooked.<br /><br />it has to be said ( and this pains me to do so ) that the reason this film works so well is because of the story and the cast. duchovney and driver are so wonderful and believable here that i honestly wanted to cry along with them. there is one particularly powerful scene when duchovney comes home after his wife has died and he slumps down on the floor of his house. as it always does, the family dog looks to the door to wait for his wife to come walking in. she doesn't and with his shirt collar still stained with blood, rob ( duchovney ) tells him that she is not coming home, ever. he then calls the dog over to him and they seem to share a cry together. the dog lets out a small moan and then rob cries. and this is one of the most realistic moments of pain i have ever seen in any character in any movie. you can feel his pain and at that moment i forgot i was watching an actor that i generally don't like, and i felt that i was watching someone that i knew moarn the loss of his beloved. this is powerful stuff.<br /><br />another strength of the film is the supporting cast. bonnie hunt has combined an ethnic melting pot of irish and italian characters that share a common bond. they share a pub called o'reilley's italian pub. that is a delicious name all by itself. and heading the diametric scale of clashing cultures is carol o'connor and robert loggia. these are two proud old men that love their homeland but love their granddaughter and niece ( i think it is ) respectively. and that is the character played by minnie driver. this scenario is ripe for comedy and hunt doesn't miss anything here.<br /><br />bonnie hunt and james belushi also share some funny moments together as the middle aged married couple and belushi gets top points as he accepts humility gracefully and shows off his ample keg of a stomach for laughs. with his family consisting of three or four kids, there is very little time for him and the wife to have quality time. and again hunt handles this with perfect elegance. <br /><br />this is a wonderful story of finding true love, knowing how lucky you are to have true love and the power of friendship and family. return to me is a wonderful romance and even though i still don't have a great admiration for david duchovney, i have to admit that he was perfect in this role and i could not picture anyone else playing his character. he was sensitive and believable and the movie was good because of him, not just because of him, but he sure added to the flavour.<br /><br />if you are a sucker for a good romance and you want a good cry, then this is the film for you. <br /><br />8.5 out of 10 i will see anything that bonnie hunt puts out with her in the director's chair.",Movie,English

"who doesn't love the muppets?! impossible it is to watch them without getting some kind of warm, fuzzy feeling inside. so, i guess what's important is that this movie seemed to very successfully capture what makes the muppets so special. i don't remember much about the details of the plot but the various moments and characters in the film i recall quite fondly. in fact, there was quite a nostalgic atmosphere to the whole movie but without being self-conscious in any bad way. refreshing for someone who possibly gets too hung up on meticulous details and technique; the ""magic"" transcends all that other stuff. 'tis indeed what movies are made of.<br /><br />so, how does the film achieve these things? hmmm, nice question! stumped am i? let's see. really, i feel like it's quite simple. the filmmakers believe in their material and don't take themselves too seriously in the process. i probably wouldn't say the film has many truly inspired moments, but it does have a certain life to it (that funnily enough a great many ""real people"" movies lack). a zest. you really want to believe in these funny little people and their adventures. they also have a certain innocence about them that makes them all the more endearing.<br /><br />generally i get the impression that the people that made the movie just weren't afraid to try whatever felt right to them at the time which gives the whole thing quite a loose feel. kind of like a really accessible and enjoyable extended jazz session. lots of talent, little predictability and plenty of warm personalities coming through. the cameos were of course a bunch of nice surprises for instance. maybe i don't feel i have much to say about it because i was half-asleep when i saw it (and/or as i write this review). anyway, i'm sort of semi-repeating myself here but i really liked the sense of family the movie had. full of love i suppose you might say. again, a feeling of nostalgia comes to mind which not many films manage to achieve so effectively or effortlessly.<br /><br />and to repeat myself once more, one of the film's best charms is its very relaxed and welcoming atmosphere. like the nathaniel hawthorne quote about happiness being (like) a butterfly, so the muppet movie greatly succeeds partially by not seeming to try to do so. same with beauty being best undiscovered or untouched or unforced or something like that. anyway, if that sounds sappy, i also reckon it was pretty hilarious.<br /><br />so, all in all, this movie was very funny, touching and difficult not to smile along to. plus it features lots of great music! highly recommended to all humans, both the young and the young at heart.",Movie,English

"this anime is a must-see for fans of evangelion. it's an earlier work of anno hideaki, but his unrestrained, dramatic style is quite in place. also, those who didn't like evangelion might find this release to bit slightly more palatable. gunbuster is rather unique to sci-fi anime in that it's actually based on real science. in fact, the show has several little ""science lesson"" interludes explaining the physics behind some of the events in the movie. one of the big dramatic points in the film is the relative passage of time at speeds near that of light. the series does a wonderful job of dealing with the imaginably traumatic experience of leaving earth on a six month mission traveling near the speed of light and returning to an earth where ten years have passed. the main character remains age 17 or 18 throughout the entire series while almost all of the other characters age considerably. be warned, this show is heavy on the sap at times. it also has a couple of the most wholly unmerited breast shots that i have ever seen. i found it fairly easy to ignore the skimpy uniforms and boo-hoo scenes, because the series is otherwise very good, but viewers with a low sap tolerance might want to stay away from this one. on an interesting note, gainax, as always, managed to run out of money in the last couple of episodes. however, they managed to use black and white film and still action sketches to produce a good resolution anyway. the ending is a bit silly, but it left me with such a good feeling in my gut i couldn't help but love it. gunbuster is, in my opinion, one of the finest pieces of anime around.",Movie,English

"i don't think i've really ever given walter matthau his due as a comedic performer. he's certainly been wonderful in plenty of lighthearted roles, but i guess i always put his success down to his characters' grumpiness and ruthlessness, a gruff contrast to the flamboyant personality of his frequent co-star jack lemmon, and, i suppose, a natural extension of his earlier work in dramatic pictures. watching gene saks' 'the odd couple (1968),' adapted from a popular neil simon play, the realisation suddenly clicked: matthau is, in his own right, absolutely hilarious! initially striking the audience as filthy, crude and generally unappealing, his oscar madison eventually manages to worm his way into our hearts, culminating in a hilariously overplayed confession of emotions that matthau rasps out in a voice not entirely his own. at the same time, while holding his own as a comedian, his interplay with lemmon is, of course, pitch-perfect; indeed, the film rightly belongs to both actors, who have never failed to light up the cinema screen by themselves, let alone together.<br /><br />calling to mind billy wilder's screenplay for 'the apartment (1960),' this neil simon comedy builds itself around around a rather morbid premise. compulsive house-cleaner felix unger (lemmon), having just been evicted by his wife of twelve years, attempts to commit suicide, but fruitlessly abandons the idea after he wrecks his back trying to open the hotel window. dejected, he arrives at the house of good friend oscar (matthau), a divorced slob who lives alone on a diet of potato crisps and green sandwiches (that might contain either very new cheese or very old meat!). oscar kindly offers felix a place to stay, but is soon overwhelmed by his friend's finicky personality and constant insistence on absolute cleanliness. the pair form an unusual sort of marital arrangement, with felix assuming the role of the effeminate and constantly-nagging wife, and oscar as the sloppy, unappreciative husband who always comes home later than he's supposed to. this is a marriage that barely lasts three weeks, and, by the end of it, we can completely sympathise with felix's ex-wife, who remains unseen.<br /><br />'the odd couple' is a terrific comedy, most of all because it has a lot of heart. for all their arguing, it's obvious that the two roommates have plenty of affection for each other, most movingly seen when felix tries to launch into a furious tirade, instead  perhaps inadvertently  ending up informing oscar how ""tops"" he his. the pair's four poker buddies (john fiedler, herb edelman, david sheiner and larry haines) are also constantly badgering each other about some obscure annoyance, but you can't deny that they've got the best of intentions. their decision to treat felix as though nothing has happened to him may have sounded fine in theory, but maybe being ignored wasn't quite the correct solution to felix's gloomy feelings of inadequacy and inconsequentiality. unlike some comedies based on popular stage plays {i was recently disappointed by wilder's 'the seven year itch (1955)}, this film doesn't simply strike at the same chord throughout, and the relationship between the two leads is progressively developed, through tears, laughter and much disagreement.",Movie,English

"""the garden of allah"" was one of the first feature length, 3-strip technicolor films. to correct a previous poster the first technicolor feature (after disney's 5-year exclusivity deal) was 1935's ""becky sharp"" which was a costume drama that used the color for it's garish color costumes.<br /><br />""the garden of allah"" looks as if it could have been shot years later as the cinematography uses not only the color but also the use of shadows. it must have been amazing for an audiences at the time to see a color feature after seeing basically only black and white films for their whole life. unfortunately, the film does not stand up to the cinematography. that being said, the film is worth seeing just as a visual treat.",Movie,English
"it's awesome! in story mode, your going from punk to pro. you have to complete goals that involve skating, driving, and walking. you create your own skater and give it a name, and you can make it look stupid or realistic. you are with your friend eric throughout the game until he betrays you and gets you kicked off of the skateboard team(you can pick a team to be on) and you then start your own team! there are many levels like new jersey, manhattan, and even school ii(not part of story mode though) from tony hawk's pro skater 2. you can unlock secret skaters like iron man, gene simmons, and another skater. you can create your own goals like skate letters, combo letters, tricktris, gap, and much more. you can create the goal pedestrian and write what they speak. if you get bored of doing that, you can do the premade goals in premade parks. the only thing i didn't like about this game was that sometimes it was hard to drive the cars. 9/10.",Movie,English
"there's a part of me that would like to give this movie a high rating. considering that it was made in 1953, this is a very courageous movie about transvestites, tackling the issue fairly seriously and sympathetically (and offering the viewer a lot of information on the subject) and trying very hard not to stereotype. the movie clearly makes the point that transvestites are not homosexuals, and that aside from wearing women's clothing they lead a relatively normal life. it deals with the pain of not being accepted in society - the plot revolves around a police officer (lyle talbot) desperately trying to understand the issue because of the recent suicide of a transvestite. so, you have to give everyone involved with this movie credit for taking on such a controversial (in the context of 1953) subject.<br /><br />having said all that, i'm also sorry to say that this movie is absolutely dreadful. in trying to portray glen/glenda's (edward d. wood) pain, the movie falls into silly (and at times surprisingly - again given the era - sensual) fantasies that make the story very hard to follow. the acting is wooden at best. none of the dialogue comes across as real; the actors look and sound like people reading speeches written by others. and - worst of all - there was no point to having bela lugosi in this movie. this was another of the increasingly embarrassing roles this poor man took on in the latter stages of his career. ""pull the strings; pull the strings,"" poor lugosi's character (called the spirit in the credits, but really coming across as more of a mad scientist) kept crying. and nothing he did really seemed to have much connection with the rest of the movie.<br /><br />for artistic merit, the movie doesn't really deserve much more than 1/10. however, for the courage involved in just putting it out, i'll give it a 3/10.",Movie,English

"i should have known when i heard anne rice left the project that the movie would disappoint me. i couldn't have predicted that years after it's release just thinking about the movie still makes me angry. the novels are amazing, and while i understand much gets lost in the translation to screen, this movie was a great big middle finger to her original work. i hope one day someone tries again, the right way, starting with the vampire lestat. they change the roles and looks of major and minor characters alike for no good reason. they destroy lestat's history. the acting of the queen is exaggerated to the point of comedy, but i just can't bring myself to laugh. the charm and allure of the novels just isn't there. the movie is a bad excuse to cram as many musicians and ""dark"" imagery as possible into one movie, hoping the teeny goths of america would lap it up. part of the appeal of the first movie, of louis' story, is that he is caught between his humanity and his curse. lestat is supposed to take over and display the magic and excitement of the vampire world. thank goodness i read the books first, or i'd have never touched them after this movie.",Movie,English
"ok, imagine that every state in the us, nay, every country has exactly the same trees growing and ground foliage. imagine, also, that a monkey-trapper's camp so far off the beaten track you had to do the first half of the approach by river has a beautifully tarmac'd, perfectly straight road leading up to it. imagine a world where you have to wear a full biohazard suit to collect a floppy disk, then you just drop it in a ziploc bag and transfer it to your pocket with no precautions as soon as you get back to the office. a world where two nine-year old girls are happy to give lots of blood without complaining. this is the world this movie is set in.<br /><br />on top of that, it's one of the most cliché-ridden pieces of excrement it's been my misfortune to witness in many a year.<br /><br />i liked it. :)",Movie,English
"first of all i would like to point out that this film has absolutely nothing to see with the dutch folklore story of the ghost ship that is also called the flying dutchman. in this film, you will not see a single sailing boat. you will not see sailors, ghosts, or anything remotely exciting. it is not the story of the ghost ship, and i wish they had notified it in the main credits or i wouldn't have watched it, because i really thought it was the film about the legend. it seems many people think the film has to do with the legend of the ghost ship, since the film is listed on the wikipedia page for the ""flying dutchman"" legend... i don't understand why. it is maybe based on the resembling legend called ""the wandering jew""? or maybe did they just adapt the worst parts of the legend? the film begins with a fight sequence that would let anyone hope the film will have battle scenes. unfortunately, it is the only battle scene of the film. then you see daniel emilfork (who was krank in city of lost children) for about two seconds, and that would let anyone hope the film will have good acting. unfortunately he is very bad in the film. the same thing can be said about italian actor nino manfredi, who was one of italia's best actors ever, and who here is condemned to embody a crazy bird wrangler with no back story whose only purpose is to seem to be the ""wise man"" of the film. and boy, does that film need wiseness! every other character of the story seems to enjoy swimming in excrement, yelling, torturing others (in excrement), fornicating (in excrement) or laying in excrement some more just for the fun of it. it seems to be such fun that each character of the story gets to have his or her turn being dumped in feces at a point or another. coming from a dutch director, you might think that extreme dirtiness and shockingly real filth are necessary elements in a period piece, elements which contributed to make dutch filmmaker paul verhoeven's film, ""flesh + blood"", such a great film. the thought of ""flesh + blood"" would let anyone hope that a film similarly filthy and visually straight-forward would be good. unfortunately, and unlike ""flesh + blood"", there is no dramatic progression, no fights, no good acting, and put simply, no ""flesh and blood"". the photography, as the opening sequence unfolds, is well-done and enticing. this too, stops very early in the film. the music, from nicola piovani (of ""la vità e bella"" fame) is repetitive and annoying, when not irrelevant (it sometimes implies that there is grandeur in a sequence, while on screen the actors are splashing in liquid dung). throughout the first ""act"" of the film, which lasts nothing less than an hour (!), the film takes place within the same perimeter, which is around the farm where the main characters live. the characters play with excrement a lot, drown in it, play in it. a long period of time elapses through numerous ellipses to allows the main character, a young boy who loves to play in excrement, to become older and play in excrement some more. the bird-man talks a lot to say foolish things in italian. spanish conquistadors speak french. nothing makes sense. everything is confused and takes hours to happen. then there is a second act called ""the ship"", in which we see what might have been a ship, a long time ago, but which is now remains of a ship (covered with excrement did i mention?). the main character, while walking a bit further away from the farm, just happens to run into it, and decides it's really cool so let's live in it. the hunchback who lived in it before is trying to kill him, but he doesn't really mind because (did i mention?) he's not very bright. he thinks the ship can navigate and hopes to sail on it, until more conquistadors show up (at least they seemed to be conquistadors because of the don quixote style hats but as i've said it's really confused who's who), make the dutchman a prisoner, along with the retarded hunchback, and they burn the ship to the ground. the last part of the film, which is really hard to bear for the spectator because it just consists of even more excrement with even more retarded middle-age peasants fighting in it, takes place in a mad asylum. yet more torture and drowning each other with feces. yet more loitering for the director, who seems to have definitely given up on his job, or passed onto the second crew camera assistant to do the rest of the job. in the end, a lot of the mentally-challenged new ""friends"" that the dutchman made die. the woman he had sex with who was his brother's wife to begin with tries to have him meet his son. the dutchman and his son talk. the film ends after two hours of dungy images and calamitous acting and technical performances. then the credits roll and the spectator fells immensely free from having to watch atrocious films with no plot that pretend to be something exciting like fantasy films based on legends, while they are nothing but a mere catalog of how full of excrement some films can get when they don't have enough financing powers to put battles instead or even horses.",Movie,English
"firstly i loved the book, more so than the more popular da vinci code and although the dvc film was not well received, i liked it and bought the dvd. however, there is no chance that i will ever want to watch angles and demons ever again.<br /><br />the film barely resembles the book, in fact only the general premise of the story is there.<br /><br />from the very start of the film i was disappointed, in the book robert langdon receives a call and fax from maximilian kohler, director of cern. who finds the body of father (can't remember the name) and then requests langdon to come, using the super fast plane... in the book the only people who knew about this technology that the father and daughter team had created were themselves and the camerlingo... in the film however, there was a massive team involved... so the tension was never there... how did they find out etc.<br /><br />leaving out or rather changing this whole part of the story was a massive mistake and was in my mind what made it a poor movie... it changed everything that happened from then on, when the camerlingo was confronted in the pope's locked room, it should have been maximilian kohler who shot the video from his wheel chair, the commander rushed in to get the camerlingo but was shot by olivetti, in the film it was the commander in the room and olivetti was shot... (err i think i got this right, but i was bored and can't really remember the events in the film)...<br /><br />there was no love interest between vittoria and robert and in the book she wasn't at cern when he arrived and was indeed was flown in from her research work. in the book all four of the preferratti were killed, but in the film the last one of the four survived the fountain. in the book vittoria was kidnapped and robert had to rescue her and it was they that killed the assassin at the church of the illuminati, not blown up like he was in the film by the camerlingo. the bit where robert was confined under a stone coffin was not there, saved by his mickey mouse watch alarm. ok in the book we are led to believe that langdon bailed out of the helicopter, fair enough to say that this was a bit far stretched, but it was important in the film, because he had to race back with the film... there was no mention of how vittoria and her adopted father became involved, this was also important in getting to know the character of vittoria.<br /><br />in all one of the worse films i have seen, i would have left early, but my brain went numb and i lost the use of my legs temporarily. a really really reeeeeeaaaaaaalllly poor attempt and not one of ron howards finest, in fact, how he will get work again is beyond me!!! i want my money back!!!",Movie,English

"of all the kung-fu films made through the 70's and 80's this is one that has developed a real cult following. with the exception of all the films bruce lee starred in this is a film that has stood the test of time and its due to the unique story. an aging kung-fu master tells his last pupil yang tieh (sheng chiang) about five pupils he has trained in the past. all five wore masks and nobody has seen the face of each other and they have all been trained differently. their specialty in kung-fu is the name they have adopted like lizard, snake, centipede, toad and scorpion. the master called them the poison clan and he does not know what has happened to them so he wants tieh to find them and help the ones that are doing good to stop the others that are evil. an old man who was once a member of the poison clan has a map to where he has hidden a lot of money and he seems to be a target. tieh does not know what they look like so he has to mingle in society and try and figure out who they are. tieh has discovered that the snake is hung wen tung (pai wei) and along with tang sen kue (feng lu) who is the centipede they kill a family to find the map. a map is found by a mystery man who turns out to be the scorpion but know one knows who he is. a local policeman named ho yung sin (philip kwok) investigates the murders along with his partner ma chow (chien sun). sin has a friend called li ho (meng lo) who is the toad and they do know of each others identity. the snake bribes the local officials to pin the murders on li ho and while he is in prison he is tortured and killed. when sin finds out he teams up with tieh and together they go to combat tung and kue. <br /><br />this film was directed by cheh chang and he was a very special director when it came to these films. chang was not your run of the mill kung-fu director and his films always had a special quality to them. while most martial arts films deal with revenge chang did not use that as a central theme. even though there is some revenge going on later in this story this film is more complex than that. five men trained by the same master in different ways and wearing masks. then they are all in the same area and not knowing who the other is. very unique story makes this film different from all the others and most of changs stories were in a class all by themselves. i wouldn't exactly put it in the same league as ""enter the dragon"" because bruce lee was a worldwide icon and the martial arts he exhibited were more authentic looking. this film still has some impossible feats like clinging to sides of walls and all the flipping through the air but this film isn't necessarily about fight scenes. its more about the intrigue of the story and the characters that are involved. that alone makes this different from all the other kung-fu films. very well made with a unique story.",Movie,English
"i don't doubt that victor mclaglen won his best actor oscar for this film by dint of a three way split among the mutiny on the bounty leads of clark gable, charles laughton, and franchot tone who were all in the same race. but the informer is still a fine film because john ford wouldn't have gotten his first best director oscar if it wasn't. no split involved in his award.<br /><br />the movie and the story by liam o'flaherty that it is based on involves a poor simpleton of a man named gypo nolan who was once a member of the irish republican army. he was cashiered out of it for some imbecilic stunt he pulled and wants back in. he's down to his last pence and if he can't get back in, wants enough for passage to america. there's a twenty pound reward for information leading to the arrest of a former comrade named frankie mcphillip played by wallace ford. in a moment of weakness he goes to the black and tan constabulary and informs on mcphillip.<br /><br />the ira is pretty anxious to find out who ratted mcphillip out and they're pretty certain it was mclaglen. he hasn't the wit to really cover his own tracks. he does make a feeble effort to implicate another man named peter mulligan played by donald meek. he also picks up a hanger-on played by j.m. kerrigan.<br /><br />the whole action of the informer takes place in 1922 in dublin from about six in the evening to early the following morning. of a necessity it is shot in darkness and shadows, making it possibly the first noir thriller. had it been done post world war ii the informer would have ranked as a great noir classic, like odd man out or the the third man which it bares a lot of resemblance to.<br /><br />john ford knew this world very well. he took some time off during the rebellion and was in ireland at the time and had a brother who was in the ira. his real name before having it anglicized was sean o'fiernan.<br /><br />preston foster plays the ira commandant dan gallagher. in the book gallagher is a harder and meaner man than foster has him here. my guess is that john ford wanted him as a sympathetic character to give movie fans some rooting interest. he makes it clear that foster has to eliminate the informer because the black and tans will grab him and get quite a bit more out of him and put the whole organization in peril.<br /><br />the ira trial scene is the highlight of the film. when foster asks donald meek whether he recognizes the authority of their court, meek ain't in a position to say no. the king's justice and writ does not run here. it graphically illustrates at that point despite occupation by army troops and constabulary, the british are indeed losing their grip on the population.<br /><br />of course the informer a rather grim story has its john ford touches, but rather fewer than you would expect. even as mclaglen is spending his money on a drunken spree, the ira is constantly in the shadows watching him and counting every farthing.<br /><br />the informer is a tale well told about ireland in a grim and dismal time.",Movie,English

"here is proof of why mary pickford was `america's sweetheart.' in this rather complex drama, mary plays the young daughter of a squatter that dare to dream of a relationship with the son of one of the `hill-toppers.' the scenes where they steal a kiss and otherwise fall in love are simply delightful. she is even willing to take a bath. that mary could pull this role off at the age of 30 is simply amazing and somewhat due to her diminutive stature (5').<br /><br />tess must face numerous physical and emotional challenges. she does so with spunk not seen in many heroines of the time. tess packs a wallop and is not shy about fighting with anyone. why she agrees to help the `hill-topper' daughter is beyond me, but she sacrifices her own happiness in order to keep a deep secret. pickford's close ups are wonderful.<br /><br />danish-born jean hersholt is simply wonderful as the villain. the scene in which he manhandles a small baby is enough to make you throw vegetables (or whatever) at the movie screen. if forrest robinson (who plays daddy skinner) had worn a beard, he would have been a match for the model used in those world war i recruiting posters of uncle sam  wants you!<br /><br />although the story is somewhat predictable and slow in the beginning, it is worth the investment in your time to see the piece or pure `americana.' the film highlights choices available to us all involving making someone else happy and what it is to be a real christian. recommended.",Movie,English

"cry freedom is an excellent primer for those wanting an overview of apartheid's cruelty in just a couple of hours. famed director richard attenborough (gandhi) is certainly no stranger to the genre, and the collaboration of the real-life mr. and mrs. woods, the main white characters in their book and in this film, lends further authenticity to cry freedom. the video now in release actually runs a little over 2 and a half hours since 23 minutes of extra footage was inserted to make it a two part tv miniseries after the film's initial theatrical release. while the added length serves to heighten the film's forgivable flaws: uneven character development and blanket stereotyping in particular, another possible flaw (the insistence on the white characters' fate over that of the african ones) may work out as a strength. viewing crying freedom as a politically and historically educational film (as i think it should, over its artistic merits), the story is one which black africans know only too well, though the younger generation may now need to see it on film for full impact. it is the whites who have always been the film's and the book's target audience, hopefully driving them to change. now twelve years after the movie's production, cry freedom is in many ways a more interesting film to watch. almost ten years after black majority rule has been at least theorically in place, 1987's cry freedom's ideals remain by and large unrealized. it therefore remains as imperative as ever for white south africans, particularly the younger ones who have only heard of these actions to see it, and absorb the film's messages. in total contrast to american slavery and the jewish holocaust's exposure, south africans' struggles have been told by a mere two or three stories: cry freedom, cry the beloved country (ok, count it twice if you include the remake), and sarafina (did i miss one?). all three dramas also clumsily feature american and british actors in both the white and black roles. not one south african actor has played a major role, white, coloured, indian or black!). and yes i did miss another international south african drama, mandela and deklerk. though this (also highly recommended) biopic was released after black majority rule was instituted, mandela was played by a black american (sidney poitier, who also starred in the original s.a.-themed cry the beloved country), while the afrikaner deklerk was played by a (bald) very british michael caine, a good performance if you can dismiss that the very essence of afrikanerdom is vehement anti-british feelings. until local sabc tv and african films start dealing with their own legacy, cry freedom is about as authentic as you'll get. as villified as the whites (particularly the afrikaners) are portrayed in the film, any observant (non-casual) visitor to south africa even now in 1999, not to mention 1977 when cry freedom takes place, will generally find white's attitudes towards blacks restrained, even understated. looking at cry freedom in hindsight, it is amazing that reconciliation can take place at all, and it is. but cry freedom at time shows not much has really changed in many people's minds yet, and that the black africans' goal to freedom and reconciliation is still ongoing. this is why if you're a novice to the situation, cry freedom, is your best introduction.",Movie,English

"'heaven's gate' is not a masterpiece, which apparently was what it needed to be upon first release to justify its great cost, and, more importantly, the continued uneasy reliance of hollywood on the auteur model of film-making. yet 'heaven's gate', seen today at last on dvd in a cut of 229 minutes, is a superb film. it is a touch lethargic in pace. but at least it is paced. quite apart from the incompetence of construction that marks many films today, there have been many films which, deliberate in form, have been severely damaged by being hacked down with no care for rhythm so the films become shapeless and confusing. beyond this, the criticisms leveled at the film have become in retrospect quite lame. if the good guys and bad guys are too obviously pronounced for a serious film, and yes sam waterston's mustachioed, fur-clad villain is comic-opera (and not in the multi-leveled manner of bill the butcher from 'gangs of new york'), and yes, the townsfolk do seem a touch 'fiddler on the roof' on occasions, then a few dozen serious films made since then, including 'titanic' and the graceless 'cold mountain' (which bears certain similarities and is a notable failure in convincing qualities compared to this film) can be castigated for exactly the same reason. <br /><br />also despite accusations, the film has a plot, quite a well-essayed plot at that. it simply does not bow to standard-form 'epic' quality, by providing titan heroes, rafts of sub-plots and confusion. it experiments with telling in a manner more like much smaller, modest films, by carefully-caught moments of character interaction, and well-textured pageant-like explosions of communal action, as with the opening at harvard and, most specially, the wonderful scene where the johnson county folk, following the lead of a brilliantly physical fiddler, make celebration on roller-skates.<br /><br />'the deer hunter' was a critical and commercial success but abandoned the first half's inspired, mosaic-like accumulation of detail, and i think in a manner similar to criticism of robert penn warren's novel 'all the king's men' and its dictionary of jacobean stunts, if cimino had not had such a strong grasp of the conventions of hollywood epics, he might have made a special rare work of art based in honest visualisation of people within their milieu. in contrast, 'heaven's gate' succeeds in screwing its narrative momentum and tension upwards in a slowly expanding arc, until the finale explodes, whilst not abandoning the mosaic approach.<br /><br />the central romantic triangle, for instance, resists standard inflections; a decent, intelligent, but psychically defeated man, james averill (kris kristofferson) competes with a hot-shot but identity-challenged young gunman nate champion (christopher walken) for the hand of a young madame, ella watson (isabelle huppert); there is no self-conscious bed-hopping, no slaps in the face, recriminations, or typical sad-sack moments, but more a sad and distanced decision by ella to choose the younger man whom she loves less because he is ready to make the commitment. ella emerges as the film's true hero (huppert's performance, though initially awkward, is really quite excellent, balancing a dewy emotionalism with a hard-hammered spirit), attempting first to rescue nate and then mustering the resistance party of immigrants into an enterprising defence. subsequently, averill is stung into action as friends die. indeed, in the process of overcoming so many traps of cliché and style, 'heaven's gate' successfully and willfully throws off the defeated outsider-heroes grace note of so many '70s westerns and portrays an eventual, vigorous, cheer-the-heroes rallying to a compromised but still relished victory. <br /><br />the social conflict of so many '70s westerns at last hardens into a fully-fledged war; where capital attempts a crushing final victory over the miscreants who stand in their way, suddenly they find a massed and more-powerful people's army, led by the man who played the thoroughly-destroyed billy the kid a decade before. this is what led the film to be described as the first marxist western, but really it simply deflowers a theme of the genre extant well before the '60s. such various and classic old-school works as william wyler's 'the westerner', and even 'shane', tell awfully similar stories. it is simply here that the romantic myth of the gunslinger has been replaced by the romantic myth of the people's revolt. in a spectacular, exiting, but realistic and thus chaotic finale, the marauding cattlemen's encampment is attacked, ringed by dust clouds punctuated by fallen horses, writhing bodies, and gunfire. averill puts his classical education to work finally by stealing a roman trick and bringing the cattlemen to the brink of annihilation before they are rescued by the cavalry (another distinctly seditious touch, but surely not so offensive after 'little big man's unrelenting depiction of native american massacres). really, it's hard to think of a more heroically american vision of grassroots resistance. the film's only real dead spot stands as an unnecessary coda indicating averill's eventual relapse, a rather potted piece of tragedy. <br /><br />despite then certain failings and a slow mid-section, 'heaven's gate' is a supreme piece of work, a genuine attempt to create a contemporary western and a new kind of epic. if one has to still join the chorus that reckons cimino was absurd in his behaviour on set and expenditure, it is regretfully. when, today, flops like 'the adventures of pluto nash' and 'k-19 - the widowmaker' see nearly a hundred million dollars sink down the drain, and yet a tag of infamy still hangs on this film, one ponders what exactly its grim death signified. the attempt at original style, the bawdy sexuality, the very hard-won sense of detail, the breathtaking rigor of the film-making and what is being filmed, all throw into contrast what is sorely lacking in so much contemporary hollywood product.",Movie,English

"""fool for love"" is one of the several now forgotten films robert altman directed throughout the 1980s. this one, a screen adaptation of a sam shepard play that features shepard in the lead role, just simply isn't very good. altman made many not-very-good films over the course of his fascinating career, and many times the fault was his. but here i think the fault lies with shepard for writing such a flimsy play. altman's direction is assured, the performances are o.k. given what the actors have to work with, but this inconsequential screenplay goes nowhere, and takes its time getting there.<br /><br />shepard is eddie, a stuntman who has a love/hate relationship with may (kim basinger). the two fight endlessly over the course of an evening spent in some dusty motel in the middle of nowhere, while a mysterious man (harry dean stanton) who may be either a figurative or literal father to both eddie and may quietly observes. randy quaid rounds out the four-person cast as a gentleman caller.<br /><br />the only dramatic hook in the entire plot is the suggestion that eddie's and may's relationship is incestuous. however, this hook feels more like a gimmick than anything. the screenplay doesn't explore their relationship in any detail, and it doesn't use their relationship to explore any more universal themes. shepard and basigner create eccentric, mannered characters who grow irritating within the first five minutes; stanton and quaid have little to do but provide reaction shots. <br /><br />the last half hour or so of the film is especially bad, when eddie's and may's back stories begin to play out in flashback over monotone, somnolent voice over.<br /><br />chalk this up to another of altman's experiments gone awry.<br /><br />grade: c-",Movie,English

"despite what a lot of other people thought about the first movie, i really liked it. this one however. how to sum it up in one word?: this movie is (and here comes the word): crap!<br /><br />but let's look at it part by part: here is the plot: finally the old queen has been removed from her castle, but her successor: snow white has problems of another sort: the court-jester, father of her son, has gone astray, as the super, spliss, goes to the extreme, to battle his gray hair and sells the royal offspring for some blond and full hair. in her desperation snow white seeks the help of bubi (otto walkees),who must first find his other six dwarf companions and then try to find the royal offspring or at least try to find the name of rumpelstiltskin.<br /><br />the whole plot seems to have been written on a weekend, where the writers were very drunk but were just under pressure from the studio to write the screenplay. <br /><br />yes, there are some good jokes. even for fans of the first part, or for fans of any of the other actors, it's really not worth buying the the dvd. believe me. <br /><br />the only thing, that at least kind of saves the movie from complete oblivion, are the performances of some of the actors. that's why i gave the move 3/10. sadly, the script is so bad that none of the actors or all of them combined can make up for the bad story.<br /><br />for example, at one point, they even cross over in our reality, and sadly.. they don't do anything funny while being here. <br /><br />still, a lot of great actors in this movie: otto waalkes, ralf schmitz, martin schneider, nina hagen, cosma shiva hagen, (especially funny): rüdiger hoffmann as the mirror, helge schneider and many more but sadly all these comedians aren't able to bring this really bad script to life. <br /><br />maybe it is a treat for some hardcore fans but for regular movie goers or by now dvd renters or buyers it's not worth the money. <br /><br />i even regret renting the movie.",Movie,English

"i walked into the movie theater, with no expectations for the film i was about to witness, ""everything is illuminated"". i walked out with a joy i have barely come to feel with american films. the directorial debut of actor, leiv schreiber, the film follows a man on his journey through the past, accompanied by an eccentric group including a brake-dancing barely english-speaking punk from the eukraine, his grandfather who believes he is blind, and their crazy dog. the first half of the film is funny and smart with an extremely european flavor in the usage of small but wonderful characters, while the second half of the film descends into a somber story of discovery and the holocaust. this little movie brings out so many emotions, and so many colors, with such a wonderful conclusion and is more than just a story of illumination, but also of relationships and connections. the acting is incredibly powerful, the story mysterious and interesting, and the artistic appeal of the cinematography, to die for. with some brilliant and absolutely touching scenes ""everything is illuminated"" managed to capture my heart.",Movie,English

"just kidding.<br /><br />seeking greener pastures in the form of hustling in new york city, jon voight is young optimist cowboy (almost forest gump-like) joe buck from texas. it does not take long for the big apple to mercilessly swallow him and his ambitions whole and very soon joe is the target of both the coldness of new yorkers and cons from its street-thugs. given his pure heart, he takes pity on one of these thugs, ratso rizzo (dustin hoffman) and later moves in with him in his wreck of apartment and the two literally struggle to survive.<br /><br />while midnight comedy is labeled as a drama, it is best described as either a tragic comedy or a comedic tragedy in my opinion. it is above all a beautiful film that is stylish in capturing the contemporary hippie-vibe of the late 1960s with its mandatory dizzying warhol-party cinematography and juxtaposing it with ultra-urban new york city. the film crams cowboy joe buck somewhere in between, thereby emphasizing his out-of-place position. we feel for his struggle to fit in, but also to merely get enough money to feed ratso rizzo.<br /><br />midnight cowboy brought tears to my eyes as it is also rich in substance and projects a lot of heart. i imagine this film must have inspired both forest gump with its pure-hearted and out-of-place lead character and, to an extent, the crocodile dundee films as it deals with almost the exact same kind of humour - a contrast between country-cowboys and slick new york cosmopolitans. very compelling and sensationally creative film that i highly recommend.<br /><br />8.5/10",Movie,English

"one of the best documentaries released in recent years. some points...<br /><br />1. hugo chavez was elected venezuela's president in 1998, his support largely coming from the poorer regions of venezuela.<br /><br />2. in 2002, a coup briefly deposed chavez. at the time, irish filmmakers kim bartley and donnacha o'briain were in caracas, shooting a documentary about chavez for british television. their film deconstructs the coup and its aftermath, and electrifyingly records history unfolding on-the-spot, outside and inside the presidential palace.<br /><br />3. chavez aimed to free venezuela from the free-market policies imposed on it by the us. though venezuela's oil was already state-owned, it was run for private benefit by executives who chavez wished to replace.<br /><br />4. despite being the world's fourth largest oil supplier, venezuela remains swamped by poverty, its resources literally sucked away by foreign multinational corporations.<br /><br />5. the documentary begins by portraying chavez's first years as president before the coup. it focuses on his popularity with the poor, and his various policies which proved popular with working class locals (educational plans, distribution of the oil revenue, grass-root democracy etc).<br /><br />6. chavez was a huge proponent of education, and printed thousands of copies of the venezuelan constitution, encouraging children and adults to study and understand it.<br /><br />7. when chavez came to power, he immediately pledged to redistribute oil profits. this, understandably, made the oil companies nervous.<br /><br />8. a media-war broke out. the six private tv stations promptly began opposing the state-run tv station. they questioned chavez's motives, sanity and sexual orientation.<br /><br />9. without media support, the coup would not have been successful. the film makes it clear that coups rely heavily on the media to disseminate information and that news can be easily fabricated.<br /><br />10. under the guise of ""re-establishing democracy"", the opposition silenced the state-run tv station, dissolved the national electoral board, supreme court, national assembly and took control of the military.<br /><br />11. moneyed interests, backed by the military elite (encouraged by the us and cia), organised a citizens' march on the presidential palace to effect the coup. snipers shot at chávez supporters, but the private media stations edited footage so it appeared that return fire was aimed at the opposition march that in fact had been safely diverted.<br /><br />12. police went on a shooting rampage against chavez supporters, further bloodying the streets.<br /><br />13. chavez, held captive, refused to resign. of course the media/government then lied, saying he had resigned, but chavez's cabinet members communicated the truth to the international community, which eventually got the message back to venezuela by cable tv.<br /><br />14. the people rose up, pressuring the return of the president they had elected, whom only a referendum could constitutionally replace.<br /><br />8.9/10 - at a little over an hour long, this doc is far too short. nevertheless, its an engrossing piece of journalism and deals with a form of ""media warfare"" which rarely gets touched upon. makes a great companion piece to ""the battle of algiers"".<br /><br />worth one viewing.",Movie,English

"or vice-versa.<br /><br />this is a french film noir directed by an american film maker (jules dassin) who had to leave the country because of being blacklisted by hollywood thanks to huac. the premise of the story is rather familiar--one last jewel heist for tony le stephanois and his buds--and so is the ending with everybody getting... well, no spoilers here, for sure, since this is the sort of film in which tension toward the ending is important.<br /><br />dassin filmed in realistic lighting in black and white on the streets of paris using actors and actresses who are not glamorous. the engaging--sometimes intruding--score by georges auric nicely enhances the movie and will remind viewers of many a similar score from american film noirs from the forties and early fifties. jean servais plays the hardcore, consumptive lead in a fedora much as humphrey bogart might have played him. tony's recently out of prison, past his prime, but still tough and decisive when he has to be, his mind still sharp when focused, the kind of anti-hero whose eyes water even though the tears will never fall.<br /><br />dassin plays the italian safecracker and would-be ladies man who knows the rules but gets careless.<br /><br />in film noir we are forced by the logic and focus of the film to identify with the bad guys. often there are levels of bad guys, the ""good"" bad guys we are identifying with and the ""bad"" bad guys who are out to do in our good bad guys, and then maybe there's a really bad, bad bad guy or two. (here we have remi grutter, played by robert hossein, a slightly sadistic druggie.) then there are the cops who are irrelevant or nearly so. in more modern film noir the bad guys are not even ""good"" bad guys, and they get away with it or something close to that. in the old film noir, which evolved from the gangster films of the thirties, the usual motto, following the old hollywood ""code,"" was ""crime doesn't pay,"" with every criminal having to pay for his or her crime before the end of the movie.<br /><br />probably the most impressive feature of rififi is how nicely the film moves along. the plot unfolds quickly and seamlessly much the way the great film directors always did it, directors like stanley kubrick, louis malle, and the best of hitchcock. some have actually compared this to kubrick's the killing (1956) and suggest that kubrick stole a little. well, directors always steal if need be, and there are some perhaps telling similarities, such as it being ""one last heist"" for the protagonist, and having the girl gum up the works. the similarities may go deeper because as this film was nearing its end i suddenly thought, oh, no! the suitcase in the back seat is going to fly out of the convertible, hit the ground, burst open, and all the money is going to fly into the air! those of you who have seen the killing may recall what happened to the money near the end of the film! which reminds me of another film with something bad happening to the money: oliver stone's u turn (1997) starring sean penn. there the money in his backpack gets blown to smithereens by a shotgun blast. ha, ha, ha! getting the dubbed version of this film would be an act of sacrilege since the dialogue (when there is some: the heist itself is done entirely without dialogue, about 30 minutes worth) is terse and easy to follow requiring only an occasional glance at the subtitles, which, by the way, are quite utilitarian and guiding as opposed to having every word spelled out.<br /><br />one other thing: all the brutality is done as sex used to be done in film, that is off camera. a guy gets his throat slit. we don't see it. i kind of like this approach. we don't have to see the gore. you could almost let your kids see rififi--almost.<br /><br />catch this one now and be on the lookout for a hollywood reprise starring al pacino and directed by harold becker coming out next year in which you can be sure that the violent scenes will be played out in full.",Movie,English

"the cinema of the 60s was as much as time of revolution as the politics and the music. filmmakers were daring to make avant-garde films discussing taboo subjects only permitted before in exploitation films. starting with both ""breathless"" and underground american cinema (such as kenneth anger), films became more and more experimental. all of this accumulated when hollywood realized they had mass commercial appeal with ""easy rider"". one of the best (and most surprising) outputs of this era was also one of the least successful initially. ""head"" was made when the monkees career was seriously waning, which is what damned one of the best psychedelic films ever made.<br /><br />the plot? well, there really isn't one, as many have said. it involves the monkees going from one surreal scenario to the next one. however, these sequences are all obviously lsd-tinged and basically mock how the monkees were sick of being confined to their light pre-fab reputation. its a shame that the film found no audience. the teeny boppers who loved them had moved onto a new fad as they always do. the psychedelic / haight-ashbury crowd to whom the film was garnered would never be caught dead at a monkees movie. its all their loss. this film may be plot less, but it is certainly not without meaning and is very intelligently put together. the crew later made both ""easy rider"" and ""five easy pieces"". the film was later revived at a 1973 raybert retrospective and it gained a very positive response, which granted it the cult following it had deserved for a long time. ironically, the monkees would fall victim to the same commercialism they protested in this film with their later 80s reunion.

"what can be said, really... ""the tenant"" is a first-class thriller wrought with equal amounts of suspense and full-blown paranoia. it's an intricately-plotted film--every detail seems included for a reason--even though the plot seldom makes sense, and much of it is never even addressed in an objective manner. therefore we are left with the increasingly unstable trelkovsky (polanski)--a meek polish man who has obtained an apartment due to the previous tenant's suicide--to guide us through a world of escalating fear and uncertainty. after an apartment-warming party thrown by a group of obnoxious coworkers, trelkovsky comes under increased, seemingly inexplicable scrutiny by the fellow occupants in his building; the rest of the film chronicles his mental deterioration and gives us a thorough mindfu*k on par with the later efforts of david lynch. ""the tenant,"" however, is more brooding and sinister, laced with unexpected comic relief, fine performances, and a truly haunting score. it's a movie that's better experienced than described, so hop to it.",Movie,English

"running out of time is probably as close to a perfect film as you're ever likely to see out of hong kong. all the elements click: a terrific script (by french writers julien carbon and laurent courtiaud) that even manages to subvert the odd cliché, reliably imaginative direction by johnnie to, and excellent central performances by andy lau and lau ching wan, the latter displaying his great comic timing to wonderful effect without ever crossing the line into parody (especially in his exasperated reactions to his superior's abysmal negotiating skills). the supporting cast is fine too, with yo yo mung making a strong impression in a tiny role, and even the often histrionic waise lee (looking remarkably, and very aptly, like a bald andy lau) reining it in to good effect. it's best not to know too much about the plot going in beyond the basic set-up  with only a few weeks to live, lau engages in a criminal game with wan's cop with no easily apparent motive  and just sit back and enjoy the ride: it's certainly worth the fare. it also has one of the most perfect love stories in recent movies, and played in a mere three scenes (the second bus ride is one of the most magical moments of film-making i've seen in ages). there's also a fine score by raymond wong as well. the most fun playing cat and mouse at the movies in years.",Movie,English
"any movie that offers bonnie hunt, sarah silverman and amy sedaris in the supporting cast has to be well worth watching, and comic actor jeff garlin takes advantage of the terrific talent he recruited for his 2007 directorial debut, a sad-sack comedy about an overweight man who feels out of step with the world around him. familiar as larry david's manager jeff on ""curb your enthusiasm"", garlin plays james, a still-struggling, 39-year old chicago actor who still lives with his widowed mother. his self-esteem is so low that he can't meet women, but it's the comical way he views his single status that makes his dilemma involving. if the storyline sounds a bit familiar, that's because the film is partially a tribute to the 1955 ernest borgnine classic, ""marty"", about a lonely bronx butcher living with his meddlesome mother. in fact, garlin uses ""marty"" as the play which james is desperate to do since he is so empathetic to the character's situation.<br /><br />naturally there is a love story of sorts in this new millennium version, and silverman plays beth, an off-kilter, sexually voracious ice cream parlor server who takes him on an underwear shopping spree. their best scene together is in his favorite convenience store where they improvise different characters in different aisles. hunt plays a lonely elementary school teacher who shares a passion with james for jazz musician ben webster. they meet accidentally in a record store and then again at a career day at her school where he hilariously exposes his sexual neuroses in front of a classroom of first-graders, including his best friend luca's pert daughter penelope (played by dakota fanning's look-alike baby sister elle). in a wedged-in cameo and looking quite a bit like jerri blank, sedaris plays the school's counselor who speaks to james after his inappropriate monologue. david pasquesi plays luca, a retirement home manager, and his scenes with garlin have an easy rapport that makes their friendship easy to believe. almost stealing the movie is character actress mina kolb, who plays james' pixilated mother with pluck and heart.<br /><br />there are also unexpected cameos from teen idol aaron carter and gina gershon (don't askbut the set-up is funny), as well as sharply played bits by director paul mazursky (as the snaky director of a candid-camera-type show, ""smear job""), tim kazurinsky (as the unsuspecting victim of that show) and dan castellaneta (as the tough-love convenience store owner). with his rueful bouts of insecurity and self-loathing, garlin's comic sensibilities resemble those of albert brooks, and the casual dialogue at its best reminds me of ""modern romance"" and ""defending your life"". the one persistent problem i had with the film is pacing as some scenes dragged out longer than necessary. the problem is more evident in the first half when garlin is trying to establish the right tempo, and the lack of real conflict adds to the sluggishness. regardless, what he does well is capture that gnawing sense of desperation one feels upon the revelation that life is not what it is supposed to be, that a significant other may be out of reach, and that a steady diet of junk food eaten on a car hood is the only sure thing when it comes to gratification.",Movie,English
"you would really need to remember the monkees and have a clear understanding as to where and how they fitted into the second half of the 1960s in order to fully appreciate this movie.<br /><br />there is no plot as such. basically, it's a crazy, mixed up pastiche of various, unrelated sequences. but, it is interesting and entertaining in its own peculiar way once you get onto its wavelength. in short, it was a classic, cleverly conceived and well crafted example of late '60s experimental cinema. it contains some good songs, some ultra-groovy cinematography and plenty of other worthwhile ideas in terms of film technique.<br /><br />i give it 7 out of 10 for several reasons. first, it took a lot of courage to make such an unorthodox movie in the commercial mainstream where both its stars and its producers were firmly ensconced at the time. if a feature movie flops at the box office, the consequences can be dire for all concerned. secondly, it was, for the most part, a creative success. and, finally, as already mentioned, it is, unquestionably, a classic of the genre and, as such, it is now historically important.<br /><br />unfortunately, ""head"" came too late in the monkees career. but, there again, they would not have been allowed to make it earlier on because it was essentially a very pointed and cynical satire of their own image. <br /><br />clearly, the members of the group knew, only too well, that the whole monkees juggernaut had just about run its race when they started work on this project. in a way, it was to be their swan song and they were determined to let it all hang out. they were tired of being treated like mere pawns in the high powered corporate game in which they had been manipulated and exploited over the preceding few years. in short, they ""wanted out"" and they were going to say a few things before they left.<br /><br />history, however, has vindicated the band. let the critics be damned. the monkees, left behind some of the best, most polished and successful pop records of the decade. yes, they had plenty of help. but at the end of the day, they stood in front of the studio mikes, they fronted the movie and tv cameras and they did the concerts. they were fun and just a little bit crazy. but, unlike some of their contemporaries, they were never threatening. you could safely introduce a monkey to your elderly aunt.<br /><br />""head"" probably borrows a bit too heavily from the beatles ""hard day's night"" but it's still worth another look for those who were around at the time or for younger retrophiles who have the ability to appreciate its significance.<br /><br />enjoy!",Movie,English

"no more corned beef and cabbage for her!<br /><br />this little romantic comedy clips along from scene to scene with a few exotic twists (some imaginary scenes and a costume party). all of this is centered around the wife of the husband(s) who is looking to break out of the doldrums, played by gloria swanson (she is twenty here!). both the leading men have a natural air that is convincing and of course swanson is perfect in all kinds of moods, from frivolous to worried to hopeful. <br /><br />behind all the games and apparent lightheartedness is that old serious problem of staying in love and not straying in love. there's a little corniness, but director demille is on top of keeping it snappy and believable in all. as with many films from this period, the subtitles do not just tell what they are saying (or thinking) but often give a kind of philosophical insight, as if to justify the tragedy (or raciness). and there is that higher purpose here, probably better without the instructional text, but it's part of the narrative style, and it's kind of quaint. <br /><br />if you are looking for visual or formal amazement, you won't find it here. but as a story, well acted, and filmed with precision and economy, it's really a great example. the events might not come as a total surprise, but it's such a modern love story, set almost a hundred years ago, it's a gas. and did i saw swanson was perfect?",Movie,English
"this trashy b movie attempts to masquerade as a study of sexual addiction, but it is really a poor excuse for a sexploitation flick. the story revolves around sammy horn (subtle name) played by michael des barres. sammy is a restaurant owner with a clueless wife grace (rosanna arquette) and a young child. he has a sexual addiction and must have meaningless sex every five minutes with any woman in his field of vision who will agree (and of course every woman on the planet finds him irresistible despite the fact that he looks old enough to be collecting social security).<br /><br />the story is centered on a conversation with his therapist (nastassja kinski) where he is describing each of his sexual exploits via flashback. this is nothing more than a convenient launching point for a parade of serial sex acts, which consumes at least 75% of the screen time.<br /><br />it is hard to know where to begin criticizing a film this bad. the production values are abysmal. the movie is shot on video with a look somewhere between a tv soap opera (at best) and an amateur porn flick shot in someone's garage. the direction by joseph brutsman is horrible with bad lighting, uninspired framing and poor actor direction. the script is vapid and the dialogue mindless and vulgar.<br /><br />women are generally portrayed as sex obsessed nymphomaniacs just waiting for an addict like sammy to come along and rough them up while feeding their insatiable appetites with some impersonal copulation. as an example, grace's sister comes over to indignantly inform sammy that she knows he's been sleeping around and that she is going to tell his wife. his response to that is to throw her up against the wall and begin raping her. about three seconds into it she has an epiphany and is instantly converted to one of his sex disciples begging him to give her more. just as they finish grace walks in and sis says to her, `oh, great to see you, gotta run to pick up timmy' and mum's the word about sammy's indiscretions. the bond of loyalty has been sealed with a good ravishment. no spoiler here because it is so typical of the obvious nature of the film that anyone who had seen the first fifteen minutes could have predicted it.<br /><br />the sex depictions are all overdone, mechanical, and so poorly simulated that they are more comical than erotic. most of them are done with both participants fully clothed. the acting is wretched. michael des barres presents all the depth of a rain puddle. he really seems to get into the thrusting and profanity of the sex parts, but when it comes to actually acting with arquette and kinski, he is adrift. rosanna arquette is the closest thing to an actor in this film, giving a bearable performance and looking genuinely hurt when she finally discovers that her perfect husband is a lecherous animal. nastassja kinski is far too compassionate as the therapist, but at least we have some acting happening here. the rest of the cast is just a collection of elevated body doubles to whom they give thought provoking lines like `hit me harder, is that the best you can do?' and `oh, godyes'.<br /><br />this movie is among the worst i have ever seen, a dubious distinction given the thousands of films i have viewed. i have given it the extremely rare dishonor of rating it 1/10. not to be seen within three hours of any meal.",Movie,English
"a typical goth chick (rainbow harvest looking like a cross between winona ryder in beetlejuice and boy george) gets even with people she feels have wronged her with the help of an old haunted mirror that she finds in the new house she and her mom (horror mainstay, karen black, the only remotely good thing about this travesty) buy. the acting's pretty laughably bad (especially when rainbow interacts with the aforementioned mirror) and there are no scares or suspense to be had. this film inexplicably spawned thus for 3 sequels each slightly more atrocious than the last. people looking for a similarly themed, but far superior cinematic endeavor would be well advised to just search out the episode of ""friday the 13th: the series"" where a geeky girl finds an old cursed compact mirror. that packs more chills in it's scant 40 minutes than this whole franchise has provided across it's 4 films.<br /><br />my grade: d <br /><br />eye candy: charlie spradling provides the obligatory t&a",Movie,English

"a 'wes craven presents' movie from 1995, directed by joe clayton and starring lance henriksen. a group of scientists save a dying man they find by their desert stranded government outpost by injecting him with their experimental virus, of course, one of their colleagues goes overboard and the virus transforms the man into a near unstoppable monster with them trapped inside. lance henriksen plays the morally offended researcher who leaves the project before all this, but returns after receiving a call for help to save the man (pre-unstoppable death machine mutation).<br /><br />deciding to combine two trips in one he brings his family along with him (they're going on vacation afterwards) and proceeds to give them entry to the top secret government facility, thus putting them right in the middle of the chaos within. in case you can't tell, this one relies on the viewer to work with it a little and put aside some petty (see: major and blatant) details.<br /><br />overall though: watch-able with mild bits of enjoyment. note: the outpost is commonly known under the title 'mind ripper'",Movie,English
"elegance and class are not always the first words that come to mind when folks (at least folks who might do such a thing) sit around and talk about film noir. <br /><br />yet some of the best films of the genre, ""out of the past,"" ""the killers,"" ""in a lonely place,"" ""night and the city,"" manage a level of sleek sophistication that elevates them beyond a moody catch phrase and its connotations of foreboding shadows, fedoras, and femme-fatales. <br /><br />""where the sidewalk ends,"" a fairly difficult to find film -- the only copy in perhaps the best stocked video store in manhattan was a rough bootleg from the amc cable channel -- belongs in a category with these classics.<br /><br />from the moment the black cloud of opening credits pass, a curtain is drawing around rogue loner detective marc dixon's crumbling world, and as the moments pass, it inches ever closer, threatening suffocation. <br /><br />sure, he's that familiar ""cop with a dark past"", but dana andrews gives dixon a bleak stare and troubled intensity that makes you as uncomfortable as he seems. and yeah, he's been smacking around suspects for too long, and the newly promoted chief (karl malden, in a typically robust and commanding outing) is warning him ""for the last time."" <br /><br />yet dixon hates these thugs too much to stop now. and boy didn't they had have it coming? <br /><br />""hoods, dusters, mugs, gutter nickel-rats"" he spits when that tough nut of a boss demotes him and rolls out all of the complaints the bureau has been receiving about dixon's right hook. the advice is for him to cool off for his own good. but instead he takes matters into his own hands. <br /><br />and what a world of trouble he finds when he relies on his instincts, and falls back on a nature that may or may not have been passed down from a generation before. <br /><br />right away he's in deep with the cops, the syndicate, his own partner. dixon's questionable involvement in a murder ""investigation"" threatens his job, makes him wonder whether he is simply as base as those he has sworn to bring in. like bogart in ""lonely place,"" can he ""escape what he is?""<br /><br />when he has nowhere else to turn, he discovers that he has virtually doomed his unexpected relationship with a seraphic beauty (the marvelous gene tierney) who seems as if she can turn his barren bachelor's existence into something worth coming home to. <br /><br />the pacing of this superb film is taut and gripping. the group of writers that contributed to the production polished the script to a high gloss -- the dialogue is snappy without disintegrating into dated parody fodder, passionate without becoming melodramatic or sappy. <br /><br />and all of this top-notch direction and acting isn't too slick or buffed to loosen the film's emotional hold. gene tierney's angelic, soft-focus beauty is used to great effect. she shows herself to be an actress of considerable range, and her gentle, kind nature is as boundless here as is her psychosis in ""leave her to heaven."" the scenes between tierney and andrews's dixon grow more intense and touching the closer he seems to self-destruction. <br /><br />near the end of his rope, cut, bruised, and exhausted dixon summarizes his lot: ""innocent people can get into terrible jams, too,.."" he says. ""one false move and you're in over your head."" <br /><br />perhaps what makes this film so totally compelling is the sense that things could go wildly wrong for almost anyone -- especially for someone who is trying so hard to do right -- with one slight shift in the wind, one wrong decision or punch, or, most frighteningly, due to factors you have no control over. noir has always reflected the darkest fears, brought them to the surface. ""where the sidewalk ends"" does so in a realistic fashion. <br /><br />(one nit-pick of an aside: this otherwise sterling film has a glaringly poor dub of a blonde model that wouldn't seem out of place on mystery science theater. how very odd.) <br /><br />but noir fans -- heck, any movie fans -- who haven't seen this one are in for a terrific treat.",Movie,English
"i liked this a lot. in fact, if i see it again(and i plan to) i just may love it. i'll echo other reviewers in saying that this movie really does grow on you as you watch. it starts kind of slowly but the way in enfolds is very natural and has a mood to it. you just get into it.<br /><br />i really liked the summery atmosphere to the movie and thought the movie was very touching as a whole. the characters have a strong element of realism and the movie very slowly and gently weaves a spell as you get involved in the various interactions between them all and want to know how it will ultimately turn out and what paths the characters will choose to take. <br /><br />i am very surprised that there are less then a dozen comments on this-there are obscure tv movies that have more comments then rich in love.<br /><br />one thing that i will say is i missed the ending which is driving me crazy and i have to watch it again to see that. this is a movie that may not be for everybody but that i feel is strongly underrated(even some of my most film buff purist friends who have seen almost every movie there is haven't seen this) and it doesn't even seem to have much of a message board but i liked it a lot and to all those who like family dramas that are warm on scenery, atmosphere and an unhurried languid pace should probably take a look at this. especially note worthy is that it takes place in south carolina so for those (like me) who love the south, and movies that take place there, this is a gem. i'll add my vote to the woefully few comments and recommend this little known flick.",Movie,English

"what a waste of a great cast. figured i'd check it out because it looked like a good stoner comedy with a lot of fairly well-known actors. what it turned out to be was a pointless collection of boring intertwining stories about several characters with minimal connections with each other. characters who start off looking like decent people but end up with not a single likable or interesting characteristic among them. calling it a comedy was a stretch as well...the only thing that made me chuckle was jack black's song, which was basically tenacious d. i waited for something big to happen but ended up with nothing more than 97 minutes of my life wasted.",Movie,English

"perhaps, we are too much attached to great spectacles when we hear of antiquity brought to screen. perhaps, we expect too much from these films. however, if we, as viewers, are offered far too little, what happens then? <br /><br />that is what i thought after seeing imperium - nerone by paul marcus, a part of the production series on the roman empire. augustus by roger young, the first imperium movie, included at least peter o'toole but what does this movie include?<br /><br />hardly anything accurate. the historical errors are so serious that the movie changes facts and constitutes rather a distorted image of the roman empire than the true history. throughout the movie, we see nero young: young man during the allegedly long reign of caligula, young man during the reign of claudius and finally during his own (historically 14 year long) reign. and...he dies the same. according to the movie, nero, born during the reign of tiberius, lives for more than 40 years but looks to be in his late twenties when he dies... continuity combined with made up history is the biggest problem of the movie, which makes it hardly logical, not to say reliable. nero loses his father, is raised by slaves. at that time, his mother, agrippina, is exiled by caligula. later, however, she suddenly marries emperor claudius who already has big children with freshly married to him messalina. at these moments of the movie, we see acte (rike schmid), nero's mistress. all right, it is historically ""accurate""; yet, no source proves that she played such a decisive role in the rise of christianity in rome. in the film, she is not only a devoted christian but even a witness of st paul's miracle (he brings a young girl marzia back to life). besides, there was, historically, nothing like nero seen on the court of caligula since nero was born in caligula's 4 year long reign (a.d. 37-41). i understand that movies may change something but such an error makes the script absolutely unreliable! and many, many other shortcomings concerning content that are hard to enumerate but after 30 minutes of watching this film, i doubted whether i was watching a historical movie or a total fantasy.<br /><br />as for its artistic features which supply us with entertainment, they are equally lame as the history here is. the performances are artificial, the cast simply have beautiful faces but weak acting abilities. perhaps, i am too much attached to peter ustinov or charles laughton in the lead, but hans matheson does not fit as nero at all. he could have some of the good moments as an actor but never as the infamous roman emperor. is he an artist who burns rome for a song? is he a cynic who disguises the love to his relatives? is he a cruel ruler who sacrifices the lives of thousands of innocent people for the sake of ""alleged justice""? none of these. he is just a young man who does not know how to rule and, in the long run, begins to release the fire burning within himself... john simm is out of place in this film as caligula and absolutely inferior to other portrayals of the character. elisa tovati is only sexy as poppaea; yet she could have been much much better. the costumes are inaccurate and the sets do not amaze. low budget results in low effects and, consequently, low entertainment.<br /><br />but what made me most angry in this movie and, as a result, i give it 1/10 are some moments that are absolutely unacceptable:<br /><br />- the death of poppaea and st paul's talk with nero at her dead body, <br /><br />- claudius' mention of the current conquest of britannia on the feast and soon his death (he conquered britannia while messalina was his wife much before his death), <br /><br />- tigellinus killing agrippina (laura morante), nero's mother, <br /><br />- nero's arguments in the speech to the senators, <br /><br />- finally, nero's death - a calm day at the lake and an indifferent suicide that leads to a moral said by acte ""let us forgive him""<br /><br />all in all, this film is a waste of time and is absolutely unneeded as yet another production concerning the roman empire. it's better to make one good film in 30 years than ten minor little ones in 5 years. 1/10 - should not have been made at all.",Movie,English

(3 victims were buried & couldn't be found so he was only convicted of 52 out of 53 of his murders.) the story actually focuses more on the forensic analyst, victor burakov played to perfection by stephen rea. a man that becomes tortured and obsessed with finding this killer despite the additional obstacles placed by party hacks, his part is essential to be sure. there is a very touching scene towards the end of the movie that mentions how in america, investigators are routinely taken off serial killer cases after 18 months whether they want to or not due to the mental strain & frustration. according to this acct, burakov worked for over 5 years before getting his first break from it. he followed the case to its conclusion, 3 years later. in this scene, his superior, general fetisov, played by donald sutherland, actually tells him he admires his dedication and apologizes for not knowing he should've given him a break sooner.<br /><br />rea's performance is so well done, he doesn't overact, chew up the scenery or do anything that distracts from his portrayal of a man who is hell bent on finding his killer. he is a man with passion, but doesn't show it in the same manner as is so usually portrayed in detective movies. he only occasionally gives outbursts after quietly putting up with more than most could stand under such circumstances. rea does so much with his face, his eyes, he doesn't need to overact. he just *is* - his character, so frustrated after so long, at one point, driven to frustration, he actually says he'd rather find 3 at one time than none in a year. of course what he means is not that he wants more people to die, he just wants some clues to catch this man. rea makes us feel for this man. he makes us understand but a glimpse of what it is to live with such horror and futility.<br /><br />a mutant to be sure, chikatilo's childhood was one which produces such ""monsters."" the character of chikatilo is very well done by jeffrey demunn. he somehow (impossible though it may seem) elicits some modicum of sympathy for himself. perhaps he is the worst of us gone terribly wrong? either way, his performance is very well done.<br /><br />donald sutherland as colonel fetisov (later promoted to general) also does a great job. he starts out seeming to be a cynical worldly official that doesn't seem much more interested in helping the investigation than anyone else blocking burakov. but he eventually becomes more than just an assistant, he actually actively participates in helping burakov. there is also a very nice turn by max von sydow as the psychiatrist brought in to help profile and figure out what kind of deviant they are looking for.<br /><br />although this movie deals with a morbid, grotesque and violent story, it really is more about what it takes to catch a killer than the killer himself. all around a very well done movie with fine performances and a great screenplay. the screenplay manages to do what the best of this type of movie does: give factual events & place them meaningfully inside a dramatic framework that makes you feel like you know the people *behind* the facts.<br /><br />9 out of 10 stars",Movie,English
"this was amongst the worst films i have ever encountered. the cinematography was dull, with long tedious shots (like a camera on a tripod filming a stage play) interspersed with ""dramatic"" angles that made little sense to the content on screen. the editing was terrible, scenes matched together with the delicacy of a butcher. the plot hinged on the viewer being familiar with the historical night in which mary shelley wrote frankenstien. the acting was forced, with the type of character development that left you with an intense interest in seeing each of them die horribly (the sooner the better).",Movie,English
"i'll be honest with yall, i was a junior in high school when this sitcom first aired on abc i didn't think i would like it at all. but with john ritter in it i felt that it had a little potential in it, plus their was something else with it i liked. the acting was great, not a lot of horrible 2nd rated comedy lines, john ritter always brings his a game when it comes to comedy . this was a great show to watch, and i'll tell you why it was a great show. my father who never watches sitcoms at all, he just watches movies, sports, and law & order, he actually sat down with my 3 brothers and 2 sisters, my mother, and myself, and watched the show i think because john ritter was in it. i honestly think this show would still be running if john ritter god rest his soul i wish he hadn't passed away.",Movie,English
"wow! <br /><br />this film is the best living testament, i think, of what happened on 9-11-01 in nyc, compared to anything shown by the major media outlets.<br /><br />those outlets can only show you what happened on the outside. this film shows you what happened on the inside. <br /><br />it begins with a focus on a rookie new york fireman, waiting for weeks for the first big fire that he will be called to fight. the subject matter turns abruptly with the only existing footage of the first plane to hit the towers. you are then given a front-row seat as firefighters rush to the scene, into the lobby of tower one. <br /><br />in the minutes that precede the crash of the second plane, and tower two's subsequent fall, you see firemen reacting to the unsettling sound of people landing above the lobby. it is a sight you will not soon forget.<br /><br />heart-rending, tear-jerking, and very compelling from the first minute to the last, ""9/11"" deserves to go down in history as one of the best documentary films ever made.<br /><br />we must never forget.<br /><br />",Movie,English
"i have always been a great admirer of nicolas roeg and ""walkabout"" is one of my favorite films. this is a film version of roegs stage play and while most of the film takes place in a hotel room it still has some of roegs cinematic flare. very unique story is about a famous actress (theresa russell) who after a hard nights work on a film in 1954 goes to a hotel to visit a famous professor (michael emil) and together in his hotel room they talk. after awhile she wants to go to bed with him but as they start to get undressed her husband is banging on the door. her husband is a famous ex-baseball player (gary busey) and he wants to know what is going on. the three of them in the hotel room talk about what is going on and what the future holds for them. meanwhile, a famous senator (tony curtis) is threatening to take away the professors papers if he doesn't testify at a hearing. theresa russell is just excellent and while she's not trying exactly to impersonate marilyn monroe she does a wonderful job of exuding the phobia's and nuances that monroe is very well known for. one thing the film does is show her as not only a woman on the verge of a mental breakdown but show her as a physical wreck as well. she talks of being unable to have children and at one point in the film she suffers a miscarriage. you can make an excellent case that this is russell's best performance and i probably wouldn't argue. the film does an interesting thing in showing many flashbacks as the characters continue to talk about one thing and in the flashback we see one of many reasons for their actions. busey also gives a good solid performance and it reminds me of what a strong persona he gives off on screen. emil as the professor is a character that has many more things on his mind then we originally thought. the last scene in this film is a demonstration of his darker side! one of the highlights of the film for me is the little conversation he has with the elevator man (will sampson of ""cuckoo's nest"") and they discuss what cherokee indians think about at all times. but of course the famous scene in this film is where russell demonstrates to emil how she does understand the theory of relativity and uses toys to show this. the professor is delighted by her demonstration and so are we! russell and roeg are married in real life and they do admirable work when they are in collaboration and this is probably their best film together. good performances and a very interesting job of directing make this a challenging and visually thought provoking film.",Movie,English
"a chicago couple, dillon and dougherty, are falsely accused of killing their daughter. people begin to wonder if they did it. the police investigate and find suspicious evidence. the couple are maligned by the public and accused in the press. the cops speculate that they are satanists and have ritually murdered their own daughter. they are charged and brought to trial. they are represented by publicity-seeking lawyers who give them bad advice and bill them for $100,000. the evidence presented against them is twisted or hidden by the police. fabricated intimations of sexual abuse are presented. their other child is taken away from them and put in a foster home. dougherty is pregnant and gives birth to find her baby removed. verdict, she didn't do it but he did. he goes to the slams with a sentence of 45 years.<br /><br />in the last third of the movie, with dillon in jail and dougherty wondering what to do next, we see people who have been antagonistic now slowly coming to the couple's defense. witnesses admit to having lied. other facts are brought to light that, finally, result in dillon's release. the killer is never found, though the movie gives us a thorough whacko as a plausible perp.<br /><br />this is a weeper from beginning to end. nothing seems to go right for the couple. oh, there are a few happy moment, maybe a party where everyone is glad to be together and tearing up with joy, or some point of evidence in their favor is discovered and people hug one another. but it's never long before someone rushes through the door with more bad news and all the faces are frozen in tragic disbelief. (usually a fade to block follows.) there isn't necessarily anything wrong with moving tragedies, although i can't imagine what pleasure we get out of seeing people suffer. there's plenty of tragedy in shakespeare too. i suppose whatever we find interesting about tragic stories lies in the way they're told. ""oh, but i am fortune's fool!"" romeo cries after killing juliet's brother. here we have dougherty running in her robe through a hospital corridor, screaming, ""where's my baby???"" there isn't any ambiguity or irony in the story -- as i'm sure there must have been in the real life events on which it's based. people are either good or bad here. or else they're bad, then they turn good.<br /><br />the film isn't aimed at exploring human quirkiness, or the way things work out. it's aimed at wrenching tears from the audience. the actors provide first-rate role models. i can't remember the last movie in which i saw so many tears. there are rivulets of tears. showers of them. cascades of them. a veritable niagara of them. a lake lacrymose of them.<br /><br />well, i'll give one example of the efficiency with which the movie is crafted. dillon and dougherty hire a chicago cop who works on the side as a private investigator (ed asner). asner is sympathetic to them but he doesn't really accomplish much. he seems to be in the movie not because of his importance to the case but because he can provide the victimized couple with a kind of philosophy -- ""learn to live with it,"" which is okay -- and because he suffers from colorectal cancer, so we can watch him take his medicine, double over with pain, and finally pass away.<br /><br />what's frustrating about the movie is that in focusing so intensely on the suffering of the couple, it sidesteps one of the more important issues that it raises -- the function of gossip in regulating private lives.<br /><br />gossip is a strange thing really. if we call it ""gossip"" it's bad, but if we call it ""public opinion"" it sounds acceptable, at the very least. of course we all have convictions about issues that may or may not be justified. (as i write, michael jackson is once again being brought to court accused of molesting a young boy, and i wonder how many of us thrilled at the news and immediately assumed he was a pedophile.) but gossip isn't all bad either. it's like water. when it's properly controlled it's a community asset. we need gossip to keep each other in line. it helps us to maintain public order. but, like water in a flood or a tsunami, it is ruinous to a village when it rages out of control.<br /><br />this is a movie that's okay if you're not looking for too much in the way of insight into human nature. it's done so cleverly that, given its goal, it's hard to argue with it.",Movie,English
"joseph h. lewis was one of the finest directors of film noir. this is surely his best.<br /><br />it doesn't have some of the standard features of what we now call film noir. though american-made, it is set entirely in england. it lacks gangsters. it lacks a femme fatale. it does not lack crime.<br /><br />the title character answers an ad. she is overjoyed that she'll be making some money as a secretary. instead, she wakes up days later as the pawn in a frightening plot. only a very strong person could survive such a terrifyingly unsettling ordeal. and nina foch gives the sense of a strong woman as julia.<br /><br />part of the excitement comes from casting against type: ms. foch has an elegant manner. she is no screaming, cowering victim. she is actually a bit icy and patrician, albeit impecunious. this makes her character's plight all the more believable.<br /><br />surely the single most fascinating element is the casting of dame may witty. she was (and is) probably most famous for the charming title character in ""the lady vanishes."" she has a sweet manner and a harmless, slightly dithering manner. but here she is far from a heroine.<br /><br />george macready is excellent as her extremely troubled son. the whole cast, in fact, is superb.<br /><br />it seems that this famous and brilliant movie was made almost by accident. undoubtedly the director knew exactly what he was doing. but he did it on a low budget. that is the thrill and charm of film noir, the real film noir: it is small, convincingly lowlife, and, in this case, unforgettable.",Movie,English
"code 46 is one of those scifi movies where the government controls who you are allowed to love, and in fact will punish you if you try to procreate with the wrong person. the haves and the have-nots live in completely separate territories, the powers that be can remove your memories, etc. we've seen this stuff before, but that's ok- no movie is 100% original. this kind of premise is always fun to contemplate. unfortunately, just imagining such a future is more interesting than actually watching code 46. the characters are boring and rarely say anything interesting. maybe that's commentary on a dehumanized future, but it's still dull to watch. it's sloooow.<br /><br />at times the imagery is nice, but usually (coupled with its ""evocative"" soundtrack) just looks like a glorified perfume commercial. code 46 also sometimes uses the kind of television camera-work that i find annoying. you know, two characters talk as the camera artlessly ""floats"" on one side. two seconds later it's floating on the other side of them in a vain attempt to keep your attention.<br /><br />my friends liked this movie. if they tried to get me to watch it again, i probably would not do so unless they agreed to pay me $50.",Movie,English
"the ali g character works brilliantly within the confines of a comedy show, but as a movie, it doesn't work in the same way.<br /><br />don't get me wrong - this is a very funny movie, full of biting, witty dialogue, that caricatures the modern british chav wonderfully well, whilst providing the viewer with a hilarious, if unrealistic story.<br /><br />one problem with this film is that the script and content is either fantastically brilliant, or it's embarrassing to watch. when i say embarrassing, i don't mean funny embarrassing a la office or extras, but rather, you'll wish they hadn't included it in the final cut. one example of this is the inclusion of a music video after the film has ended, to the tune of, ""this is how we do it."" whenever i watch the film, i stop the dvd when it says the end, and leave it at that.<br /><br />overall, ali g indahouse is a good film, worth watching a couple of times. the script is enjoyable to an extent, and there are no issues as far as acting goes. however, refinement is the key word here.<br /><br />ali g is a better television programme. borat is a better film.",Movie,English
"can anybody do good cgi films besides pixar? i mean really, animation looked antiquated by 2006 standards and even by 1995 toy story standards. or maybe they spent all their budget on hugh jackman. whatever their reasoning, the story truly did suck.<br /><br />somehow, hugh jackman is a rat - a rat that is flushed down a toilet. yeah i know, seems stereotypical. but then the sewer mimicked the ways of london - to an extent. throw in a promise of jewels (????) and an evil(??) frog and you get a pathetic attempt at entertainment.<br /><br />i would like to say something entertained me. maybe the hookup in the movie? or maybe the happily-ever-after rat relationship. but nothing did. it had the talent, but it blew up. d-",Movie,English
"i had no idea what this film was about or even knew that it existed until about 1 month ago when i stumbled upon when i was searching for other films that stared dominic monaghan. i thought this film was a strange insight into the mind of a none sleeper and what his/her mind may be going through in the hours that they spend awake when the rest of the world around them is asleep,it was an interesting film and a good part was played by dom.......i believe that even though this film you cannot buy anywhere (well i've never seen it anywhere) you must see it if you ever get the chance because it will really make you think about those people around us that cannot sleep and have to suffer night after night of not been able to sleep or only get about 1 hour of sleep every night so overall it was an interesting film of good substance.",Movie,English
"i am rating this an 8 because of the premise of the film. the acting was fine, there wasn't anyone that stood out as amazing or appalling. it is disturbingly true that intelligent people are having less and less children, or choose to have none at all...whereas dumb ass ""w in '04"" supporters are procreating like rabbits. and, though i don't believe the earth will actually exist in 500 years, i can see mike judge's parodied prophet coming to be, as life imitating art. the world is being run by idiots, and it will get worse as the intelligent free-thinking people become the minority and the ""git 'er done"" fans outnumber them. the proof is our farce of an election.<br /><br />but i digress. if you are fortunate enough to have this playing in your city, go see it. i have paid my $7.50 plus popcorn to see far worse rubbish than this (date movie or napoleon dynamite anyone?). there are laughs, there are cringes, but overall this is entertaining. if you have half a brain, you will think to yourself how this movie, though funny, is spot on (accurate) and a *tiny* bit uncanny. i'm not surprised at all that this movie is almost completely unknown, as fox was the one distributing this, and they wouldn't want any of their sheep to see this and think ""maybe i will read a book, and not watch 'next', or 'cheaters', or 'ow my balls'."" if our society doesn't stop the dumbing down of everything,and the bastardisation of the english language (ahem, mr. bush), then this really is where we are going.",Movie,English
